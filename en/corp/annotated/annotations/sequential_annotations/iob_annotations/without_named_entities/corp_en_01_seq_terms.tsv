For	O

Belgium	O

What	O
is	O
corruption	B
?	O

Corruption	B
is	O
a	O
manifestation	O
of	O
criminality	B
.	O

It	O
can	O
be	O
very	O
damaging	O
to	O
companies	B
and	O
to	O
society	B
.	O

It	O
leads	O
to	O
distortion	B
of	I
competition	I
,	O
frightens	O
off	O
investors	O
and	O
jeopardizes	O
the	O
further	O
development	O
of	O
sound	O
companies	B
.	O

Corruption	B
is	O
morally	O
reprehensible	O
and	O
undermines	O
trust	O
in	O
society	B
and	O
in	O
democracy	O
.	O

The	O
business	B
community	I
sees	O
it	O
as	O
the	O
main	O
obstacle	O
to	O
investment	B
in	O
certain	O
countries	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
longer	O
term	O
,	O
corruption	B
adds	O
to	O
costs	B
,	O
both	O
to	O
the	O
community	O
and	O
for	O
companies	B
.	O

Often	O
it	O
is	O
accompanied	O
by	O
a	O
deterioration	O
of	O
quality	O
and	O
safety	O
.	O

For	O
a	O
natural	B
or	O
a	O
legal	B
person	I
,	O
corruption	B
means	O
the	O
soliciting	O
,	O
acceptance	O
or	O
receipt	O
of	O
any	O
form	O
of	O
advantage	B
,	O
in	O
an	O
official	O
context	O
,	O
to	O
gain	O
acceptance	O
for	O
a	O
given	O
practice	O
or	O
behaviour	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
also	O
the	O
offering	O
or	O
granting	O
of	O
such	O
advantage	B
to	O
induce	O
a	O
person	O
to	O
accept	O
such	O
behaviour	O
.	O

The	O
law	B
applies	O
to	O
Belgian	O
individuals	O
and	O
companies	B
active	O
both	O
in	O
Belgium	O
and	O
abroad	O
.	O

Belgium	O
also	O
makes	O
no	O
distinction	O
between	O
national	O
,	O
international	O
and	O
foreign	O
office-holders	B
.	O

It	O
makes	O
no	O
difference	O
whether	O
the	O
bribery	B
takes	O
place	O
directly	O
or	O
through	O
intermediaries	B
;	O
nor	O
whether	O
the	O
advantage	B
is	O
intended	O
for	O
oneself	O
or	O
for	O
a	O
third	B
party	I
.	O

It	O
is	O
also	O
irrelevant	O
whether	O
it	O
happens	O
in	O
the	O
public	B
or	O
the	O
private	B
sector	I
.	O

Both	O
the	O
person	O
offering	O
such	O
advantages	B
and	O
the	O
recipient	O
can	O
be	O
convicted	B
of	O
corruption	B
.	O

Therefore	O
Belgian	O
law	B
covers	O
both	O
private	B

public	B
bribery	I
and	O
both	O
active	B
and	O
passive	B
bribery	I
