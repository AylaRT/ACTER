the	O
true	O
problem	O
of	O
the	O

against	I

seems	O
to	O
lie	O
rather	O
in	O
the	O
field	O

i.e.	O
preventing	O
,	O
investigating	O
,	O
prosecuting	B
and	O
adjudicating	B
corruption	B
cases	I

This	O
is	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
corruption	B
is	O
often	O
referred	O
to	O
as	O
the	O
crime	B
without	O
(	O
direct	O
)	O
victim	B

Hence	O

there	O

to	O
report	B

authorities	I
and	O
indeed	O
very	O
few	O
cases	B
of	I
corruption	I
are	O
reported	B
.	O

This	O
is	O
probably	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
corruption	B
usually	O
is	O
sealed	O
through	O
the	O
pact	B
of	I
silence	I
between	O
briber	B
and	O
bribee	B
,	O
who	O
have	O
a	O
mutual	O
interest	O
in	O
concealing	O
their	O
activities	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
possible	O
.	O

Furthermore	O
there	O
are	O
only	O
very	O
limited	O
statistics	O
and	O
crime	B
records	I
on	O
corruption	B
cases	I
,	O
and	O
those	O
that	O
exist	O
do	O
not	O
serve	O
as	O
indicators	O
of	O
the	O
general	O
problem	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
high	O
number	O
of	O
unreported	O
cases	O
.	O

Consequently	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
difficult	O
to	O
draw	O
the	O
right	O
conclusions	O
and	O
the	O
only	O
way	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
know	O
more	O
is	O
to	O
convince	O
witnesses	B
to	O
report	B
corruption	B
cases	I

This	O
can	O
only	O
be	O
achieved	O
