Introduction	O

Four	O

five	O
EU	O
citizens	O
regard	O
corruption	B
as	O
a	O
serious	O
problem	O
in	O
their	O
Member	O

.	O

Despite	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O
European	O
Union	O
over	O
the	O
last	O
decades	O
has	O
contributed	O
significantly	O
to	O
opening	O
up	O
Europe	O
and	O
making	O
it	O
more	O
transparent	B
,	O
it	O
is	O
evident	O
that	O
a	O
lot	O
remains	O
to	O
be	O
done	O

It	O
is	O
not	O
acceptable	O
that	O
an	O

120	O

or	O
one	O

This	O
is	O
certainly	O
not	O
a	O
new	O
problem	O
to	O
the	O
EU	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
totally	O
eradicate	O
corruption	B
from	O
our	O
societies	B
,	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
telling	O
that	O

Although	O
the	O
nature	O
and	O

it	O

its	O
