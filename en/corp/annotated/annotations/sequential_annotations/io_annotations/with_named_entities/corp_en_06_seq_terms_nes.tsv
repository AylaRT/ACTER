drawing	O
up	O
the	O

international	O
anti-corruption	I
instruments	I
-	O
the	O
true	O
problem	O
of	O
the	O
fight	I
against	I
corruption	I
seems	O
to	O
lie	O
rather	O
in	O
the	O
field	O
of	O
implementing	O
these	O
laws	I
,	O
i.e.	O
preventing	O
,	O
investigating	O
,	O
prosecuting	I
and	O
adjudicating	I
corruption	I
cases	I
.	O

This	O
is	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
corruption	I
is	O
often	O
referred	O
to	O
as	O
the	O
crime	I
without	O
(	O
direct	O
)	O
victim	I
.	O

Hence	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
rarely	O
an	O
affected	O
party	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
report	I
a	O
corruption	I
case	I
to	O
police	I
and	O
judicial	I
authorities	I
and	O
indeed	O
very	O
few	O
cases	I
of	I
corruption	I
are	O
reported	I
.	O

This	O
is	O
probably	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
corruption	I
usually	O
is	O
sealed	O
through	O
the	O
pact	I
of	I
silence	I
between	O
briber	I
and	O
bribee	I
,	O
who	O
have	O
a	O
mutual	O
interest	O
in	O
concealing	O
their	O
activities	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
possible	O
.	O

Furthermore	O
there	O
are	O
only	O
very	O
limited	O
statistics	O
and	O
crime	I
records	I
on	O
corruption	I
cases	I
,	O
and	O
those	O
that	O
exist	O
do	O
not	O
serve	O
as	O
indicators	O
of	O
the	O
general	O
problem	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
high	O
number	O
of	O
unreported	O
cases	O
.	O

Consequently	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
difficult	O
to	O
draw	O
the	O
right	O
conclusions	O
and	O
the	O
only	O
way	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
know	O
more	O
is	O
to	O
convince	O
witnesses	I
to	O
report	I
corruption	I
cases	I
.	O

This	O
can	O
only	O
be	O
achieved	O
by	O
the	O
effective	O
protection	O
of	O
whistleblowers	I
against	O
victimisation	O
and	O
retaliation	I
