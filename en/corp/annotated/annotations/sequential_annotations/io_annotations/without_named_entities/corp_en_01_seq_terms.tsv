Preface	O

Conscious	O

its	O
central	O
position	O
within	O
the	O
European	O

,	O
Belgium	O
has	O
,	O
for	O
many	O
years	O
,	O
taken	O
a	O
firm	O
line	O
against	O
corruption	I
in	O
national	O
and	O
international	O
transactions	I
.	O

For	O
this	O
purpose	O
,	O
a	O
major	O
reform	O
was	O
carried	O
out	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
1990s	O
.	O

This	O
affected	O
aspects	O
of	O
both	O
the	O
criminal	I
liability	I
of	O
legal	I
persons	I
and	O
the	O
implications	O
in	O
fiscal	I
and	O
criminal	I
law	I
.	O

Since	O
then	O
,	O
action	O
against	O
corruption	I
has	O
been	O
a	O
priority	O
of	O
the	O
Belgian	O
government	I
in	O
its	O
National	O

Corruption	I
occurs	O
in	O
various	O
forms	O
and	O
attracts	O
severe	O
penalties	I

By	O
means	O
of	O
this	O
brochure	O
,	O
Belgium	O
wants	O
to	O
raise	O
the	O
awareness	O
of	O
companies	I
engaged	O
in	O
the	O
international	O
markets	I
for	O
goods	I
and	O
services	O
about	O
the	O
consequences	O
of	O
corruption	I

Responsible	O

requires	O
a	O
clear	O
definition	O
of	O
what	O
is	O
acceptable	O
or	O
unacceptable	O

Belgium	O
hopes	O
that	O
this	O
brochure	O
will	O
raise	O
the	O
awareness	O
of	O
commercial	I
players	O
and	O
warn	O
them	O
of	O
the	O
risks	O
associated	O
with	O
their	O
business	I

What	O
is	O
corruption	I
?	O

Corruption	I
is	O
a	O
manifestation	O
of	O
criminality	I
.	O

It	O
can	O
be	O
very	O
damaging	O
to	O
companies	I
and	O
to	O
society	I
.	O

It	O
leads	O
to	O
distortion	I
of	I
competition	I
,	O
frightens	O
off	O
investors	O
and	O
jeopardizes	O
the	O
further	O
development	O
of	O
sound	O
companies	I
.	O

Corruption	I
is	O
morally	O
reprehensible	O
and	O
undermines	O
trust	O
in	O
society	I
and	O
in	O
democracy	O
.	O

The	O
business	I
community	I
sees	O
it	O
as	O
the	O
main	O
obstacle	O
to	O
investment	I
in	O
certain	O
countries	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
longer	O
term	O
,	O
corruption	I
adds	O
to	O
costs	I
,	O
both	O
to	O
the	O
community	O
and	O
for	O
companies	I
.	O

Often	O
it	O
is	O
accompanied	O
by	O
a	O
deterioration	O
of	O
quality	O
and	O
safety	O
.	O

For	O
a	O
natural	I
or	O
a	O
legal	I
person	I
,	O
corruption	I
means	O
the	O
soliciting	O
,	O
acceptance	O
or	O
receipt	O
of	O
any	O
form	O
of	O
advantage	I
,	O
in	O
an	O
official	O
context	O
,	O
to	O
gain	O
acceptance	O
for	O
a	O
given	O
practice	O
or	O
behaviour	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
also	O
the	O
offering	O
or	O
granting	O
of	O
such	O
advantage	I
to	O
induce	O
a	O
person	O
to	O
accept	O
such	O
behaviour	O
.	O

The	O
law	I
applies	O
to	O
Belgian	O
individuals	O
and	O
companies	I
active	O
both	O
in	O
Belgium	O
and	O
abroad	O
.	O

Belgium	O
also	O
makes	O
no	O
distinction	O
between	O
national	O
,	O
international	O
and	O
foreign	O
office-holders	I
.	O

It	O
makes	O
no	O
difference	O
whether	O
the	O
bribery	I
takes	O
place	O
directly	O
or	O
through	O
intermediaries	I
;	O
nor	O
whether	O
the	O
advantage	I
is	O
intended	O
for	O
oneself	O
or	O
for	O
a	O
third	I
party	I
.	O

It	O
is	O
also	O
irrelevant	O
whether	O
it	O
happens	O
in	O
the	O
public	I
or	O
the	O
private	I
sector	I
.	O

Both	O
the	O
person	O
offering	O
such	O
advantages	I
and	O
the	O
recipient	O
can	O
be	O
convicted	I
of	O
corruption	I
.	O

Therefore	O
Belgian	O
law	I
covers	O
both	O
private	I
and	O
public	I
bribery	I
and	O
both	O
active	I
and	O
passive	I
bribery	I
.	O

In	O
other	O
words	O
,	O
corruption	I
may	O
occur	O
at	O
various	O
levels	O
and	O
in	O
various	O
forms	O
.	O

All	O
these	O
forms	O
of	O
corruption	I
are	O
criminal	I
offences	I
in	O
Belgium	O
.	O

In	O
fact	O
an	O
incidental	O
condition	O

it	O

It	O
applies	O
not	O

to	O

about	O

you	O
should	O

this	O

are	O
the	O

to	O

to	O
work	O
towards	O
ethical	I

in	O
a	O
climate	O
of	O

There	O
is	O
also	O
an	O
inter-departmental	O
working	O
group	O
in	O
the	O

,	O
which	O
exists	O
to	O
follow	O
up	O
and	O
implement	O
the	O
recommendations	O
of	O
the	O
OECD	O
,	O
GRECO	O
and	O
the	O
UN	O
concerning	O

The	O
working	O
group	O
brings	O
together	O
the	O
main	O
partners	O
in	O
Belgian	O
anti-corruption	I
policy	I
.	O

Furthermore	O
,	O
a	O
Network	O
of	O
Expertise	O
on	O

has	O
been	O
set	O
up	O
under	O
the	O
auspices	O
of	O
the	O
Board	O
of	O
Public	I
Prosecutors-General	I
.	O

It	O
co-operates	O
very	O

with	O
the	O
Network	O
of	O
Expertise	O
on	O
Economic	I

In	O
any	O
case	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
need	O
for	O
information	O
exchange	O
and	O
contacts	O
between	O
the	O
preventive	O
and	O
reactive	O
arms	O

This	O
should	O
take	O
place	O
in	O
a	O
more	O
structured	O
,	O
institutionalized	O
way	O

A	O
bridge	O
is	O
also	O
being	O
built	O
between	O
the	O
public	I
and	O
private	I
levels	O
.	O

The	O
private	I
sector	I
should	O
be	O
made	O
more	O
aware	O
of	O
the	O
misdemeanour	I
of	O
corruption	I
,	O
and	O
all	O
kinds	O
of	O
ethically	I
unacceptable	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
role	O
which	O
the	O
public	I

should	O
fulfil	O

This	O
multi-disciplinary	O

integrated	O
method	O
of	O
working	O
against	O

is	O
gradually	O
beginning	O
to	O
bear	O
fruit	O

Thus	O
the	O
inter-departmental	O
working	O
group	O
,	O
mentioned	O
above	O
,	O
has	O
prompted	O
the	O
amendment	O
of	O
the	O
laws	I
on	O
bribery	I

Its	O
members	O
have	O
each	O
