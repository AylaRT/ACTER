Introduction	O

Four	O
out	O
of	O
five	O
EU	O
citizens	O
regard	O
corruption	I
as	O
a	O
serious	O
problem	O
in	O
their	O
Member	O
State	O
.	O

Despite	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O
European	O
Union	O
over	O
the	O
last	O
decades	O
has	O
contributed	O
significantly	O
to	O
opening	O
up	O
Europe	O
and	O
making	O
it	O
more	O
transparent	I
,	O
it	O
is	O
evident	O
that	O
a	O
lot	O
remains	O
to	O
be	O
done	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
not	O
acceptable	O
that	O
an	O
estimated	O
120	O
billion	O
Euros	O
per	O
year	O
,	O
or	O
one	O
percent	O
of	O
the	O
EU	O
GDP	I
,	O
is	O
lost	O
to	O
corruption	I
.	O

This	O
is	O
certainly	O
not	O
a	O
new	O
problem	O
to	O
the	O
EU	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
totally	O
eradicate	O
corruption	I
from	O
our	O
societies	I
,	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
telling	O
that	O
the	O
average	O
score	O
of	O
the	O
EU27	O
in	O
Transparency	I
International	O
's	O
Corruption	I
Perception	I
Index	I
has	O
improved	O
only	O
modestly	O
over	O
the	O
last	O
ten	O
years	O
.	O

Although	O
the	O
nature	O
and	O
extent	O
of	O
corruption	I
vary	O
,	O
it	O
harms	O
all	O
EU	O
Member	O
States	O
and	O
the	O
EU	O
as	O
a	O
whole	O
.	O

It	O
inflicts	O
financial	I
damage	O
by	O
lowering	O
investment	I
levels	I
,	O
hampering	O
the	O
fair	O
operation	O
of	O
the	O
internal	I

other	O
serious	O
crimes	I
,	O
such	O
as	O
trafficking	O
in	O
drugs	O
and	O
human	O
beings	O
.	O

Moreover	O
,	O
if	O
not	O
addressed	O
,	O
corruption	I
can	O
undermine	O
trust	O
in	O
democratic	O
institutions	O
and	O
weaken	O
the	O

of	O

Over	O
the	O

some	O

At	O
EU	O

,	O
the	O

developed	O

the	O
adoption	O
of	O

on	I
corruption	I
in	O
the	O
private	I

and	O

EU	O
to	O
the	O
United	O

)	O

The	O
Treaty	O
on	O
the	O
Functioning	O
of	O
the	O
European	O

recognises	O
that	O
corruption	I
is	O
a	O
serious	O

with	O
a	O
cross-border	O
dimension	O

to	O
some	O

been	O
integrated	O
within	O
a	O

of	O
EU	O
policies	I
.	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
implementation	O
of	O
the	O
anti-corruption	I
legal	I
framework	I
remains	O
uneven	O
among	O
EU	O
Member	O

and	O
unsatisfactory	O
overall	O
.	O

The	O
EU	O
anti-corruption	I
legislation	I
is	O
not	O
transposed	I
in	O
all	O
Member	O

Some	O
countries	O
have	O
not	O
ratified	O
the	O
most	O
important	O
international	O

More	O

,	O
even	O
where	O
anti-corruption	I
institutions	O
and	O
legislation	I
are	O
in	O
place	O
its	O
enforcement	I
is	O
often	O
insufficient	O
in	O
practice	O
.	O

This	O
reflects	O
a	O
lack	O
of	O
firm	O
political	I
commitment	O
on	O
the	O
part	O
of	O
leaders	O
and	O
decision-makers	O
to	O
