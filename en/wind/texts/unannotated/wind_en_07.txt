WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT WIND TURBINES WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT WIND TURBINES AND THE GREEN ENERGY ACT The Green Energy Act, 2009 is a provincial legislation intended to "foster growth of renewable energy projects which use cleaner sources of energy, and to removing barriers to and promoting opportunities for renewable energy projects and to promoting a green economy." -Preamble, Green Energy Act, R.S.O. c. 12 The key phrases being: "removing barriers" - what barriers? and, "promoting opportunities" - for whom and at what cost? The Green Energy Act, 2009 is a short piece of legislation consisting of twenty clauses but amends a further eleven other Acts, including: Electricity Act, 1998; Ministry of Energy Act; Ontario Energy Board Act, 1998; Clean Water Act, 2006; Environmental Bill of Rights; Environmental Protection Act; Ontario Water Resources Act; Co-Operative Corporations Act; Building Code Act, 1992; Planning Act; and, Ministry of Natural Resources Legislations like the Green Energy Act, 2009 are to a greater or lesser extent, enabling Acts to permit a ministry, in this case numerous ministries, to pass Regulations which clarify what the enabling legislation actually means in terms the actual governmental powers being created and applied. For example, the recently passed Ontario Regulation 359/09 made under the Environmental Protection Act changes the approval process for Renewable Energy Projects. The Regulation, amongst other things sets out minimum separation distances of the turbine from "noise receptors" (meaning homes, churches, schools, etc) by and large based a the computer-modeled noise capacity of the wind turbine. Ontario Regulation 359/09 determines the set-backs from houses based on the "Noise Guidelines for Wind Farms" dated October, 2008 - the wind turbine facility may "not exceed the lowest hourly ambient sound level" being 40dBA at the noise receptor. This is notable, given the fact that the Ministry of Environment stated on September 30, 2009 that "there is currently no scientifically accepted field methodology to measure wind turbine noise to determine compliance or to determine non-compliance with Certificate of Approval limits". The Green Energy Act, 2009 also made direct changes to various legislations that effect citizens' daily lives, to a greater and lesser extent. One important legislation amended by the Green Energy Act that affects the taxpayers of a municipality directly and measurably is the Planning Act, R.S.O. 1990 c.P.13. Wind Turbine facilities in Ontario are typically placed in areas zoned Agricultural which ordinarily requires an application to change the zoning to permit a non-agricultural industrial use in the agriculturally zoned area. Such an application would ordinarily be refused, as most, if not all, Official Plans and Zoning Bylaws in Ontario prohibit industrial uses in agricultural areas that are not agriculturally related, for what should be, obvious reasons: the preservation of our agricultural lands. "The preservation of agricultural lands" as well as other social and economic priorities such as Long Term Economic Prosperity, Natural Heritage; Cultural Heritage and Archeology, and Protecting Public Health and Safety (amongst numerous other generally agreed upon social and economic values and priorities) are set out in a document called the Provincial Policy Statement, (2005) whose purpose is to guide planning decisions by obliging electing officials to weigh all of the relevant values and priorities involved in the decision. Wind Turbine Facilities not being consistent with many of those priorities mentioned above are therefore "barriers" for Renewable Energy Projects, specifically, Wind Turbines. Wind Turbines however, are consistent with one of the priorities set out in the recently amended Provincial Policy Statement, (2005) under "Energy and Air Quality". To permit Wind Turbine Facilities in Chatham-Kent, the most heavily populated agricultural area in Canada, having 90% of the Class 1 farmland in Canada, it was necessary for your Council to ignore all other competing priorities, other than Energy and Air Quality to justify granting approvals for Wind Turbine Facilities. It was further necessary to ignore the peer review scientific studies showing the negative health consequences of placing Wind Turbines any closer than 1-2 kilometers from someone's home. It was also necessary for council to ignore the overwhelming evidence from England, Australia and the United States of the profoundly negative effect the proximity Wind Turbines will have on proper values in their vicinity. Our municipal council, much to their collective relief has now had any authority to plan our community as it concerns the placing of this industrial use in our agricultural lands taken from them by the Green Energy Act, 2009 . The Green Energy Act, 2009 has simply stated that the Official Plan for Chatham-Kent and the Provincial Policy Statement, (2005) no longer apply to Renewable Energy Facilities, except, of course, for the Niagara Escarpment Plan; Chatham-Kent landscapes, mainly the vista between Clearville and Morpeth looking out over Lake Erie, are "not being considered unique" either within Southern Ontario or Chatham-Kent according to the Environmental Screening Reports required in support of Wind Turbine Facility applications in proximity to Lake Erie and Lake St. Clair. "The area has no designated or recognized viewscapes", except of course, to the residents and the thousands of tourists who use Number 3 highway as their access to Chatham-Kent, precisely because of the viewscape between Clearville and Morpeth. For the citizens of Chatham-Kent, the Green Energy Act, 2009 simply institutionalizes the ignorance, arrogance, incompetence and lack of vision of the Council and Mayor of the Municipality of Chatham-Kent. Your provincial government could care less about the economic and health impacts on the citizens of Chatham-Kent given our small population and minimal voting power and are more concerned with appearing to address global warming without actually doing anything. Now, our M.P.P. is Pat Hoy and a member of the governing Liberal Party. Mr. Hoy supported the position of property owners of the north shore of Lake Erie in Essex County at Pigeon Bay in opposing the placement of Wind Turbines off their shores in Lake Erie - the proposal would no doubt have devastated those lakeshore owners' property values. Mr. Hoys' opposition was because "Pigeon Bay is in the direct path of a very significant bird and butterfly migration and a flight path to the renowned Jack Miner Bird Sanctuary and Point Pelee National Park. Mr. Hoy should then be interested to know that the waterfowl migration focal point of both the Atlantic Flyway and the Mississippi Flyway is in the Municipality of Chatham-Kent. The major staging ground for waterfowl migrating north and south is Lake St. Clair and that area of the north shore of Lake Erie between Clearville and Rondeau Bay, which passes over two provincial parks - Rondeau and the new, to be announced provincial park at Clear Creek near Clearville and Lake Erie. The north shore of Lake Erie is also the primary migration route for monarch butterflies, hawks, eagles and the spring warbler migration - a world class birding phenomenon. Mr. Hoy maintains however, that "I support all wind projects on land in my riding thus far". Health concerns and property values on our lake shores apparently do not concern your current member of the provincial parliament. Stay tuned for our next flyer where we will inquire into who exactly benefits from Wind Turbines "opportunities" - I'll give you a hint - it isn't you.
