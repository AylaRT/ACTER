Modifications in the synchronous generator

With PSCAD, it is very easy to change a single machine into a "multiple machine" equivalent to several identical machines connected in parallel. It requires only a few changes in the generator's parameterization: • In the "configuration" window: Choose: "Machine scaling factor : Yes" • In the "basic data", choose "Number of coherent machines: 100"

There are also a few change in the transformer connected to the inverter: • The apparent power becomes 300MVA • As explained above, the Primary side rated voltage becomes 0.6 kV

Modifications in the grid

The grid is always the same, but in order to test the voltage regulation, we will force the voltage level to 0.95 p.u. = 0.95*34.5 ≅ 32 KV. Change the value of the voltage source from 32.5kV to 32 kV as follows:

PWM Regulation drives

You can begin with the PWM drive shown in the example statcom_6pls_pwm_sld.psc and copy/paste the components to adapt them to our model.

11.2.1

Principles

The voltage will be regulated through a PWM drive in order for the voltage at the connection point to equal 1 p.u. ( 1pu = 34.5kV). To see the effect of this regulation, the voltage magnitude of the main voltage source of the grid is set to 0.95 p.u. = 32kV, as shown previously. The following parts will detail the regulation device. The drive of our device can be divided into 3 parts: • Generation of the triangular waveform • Generation of the reference • Generation of the firing pulses of the 6 GTO of the inverter

Configure the MODULO as follows:

Figure 67: Modulo characteristics

The output of the PLL is a signal varying between 0 and 360° synchronized on the 3phase voltages (Vna,Vnb,Vnc) at the frequency of the system. This signal is multiplied by 33 and the modulo function gives the same signal at a carrier frequency equal to 33 times the fundamental frequency. Each period of the carrier frequency is transformed in a triangular period with amplitude from -1 to 1 with the transfer function. The signal is separated into two complementary arrays of 6 triangular signals: TrgOn (which will generate the on firing pulses) and TrgOff (which will generate the Off firing pulses).

An error signal Shift is produced from the reference order of the voltage at the connection in Per unit and the measured 3phase RMS voltage at the connection point. Then, this error is subtracted from the six outputs of the PLL, which are 6 signals synchronized on the measured output voltage of the inverter with a 60° phase difference between each one. These signals are organized in order to fit with the GTO arrangement on the bridge and we obtain the reference signals : • RsgnOn for the ON firing pulse • RsgnOff for the Off firing pulse.

The interpolation method of PSCAD requires using this exact component to generate the correct gate signals (g1,g2,g3,g4,g5,g6), which are arrays of two values.

At t = 5s the resistance is shunted, thus the voltage drops. When Vdv reaches 1520V, the regulation starts. Before the starting of the regulation, the connection point voltage ( V4) is imposed by the grid. Afterward, the regulation set it to 1pu The wind farm produces 3.5 MW to maintain the voltage at 1pu (P4).

Constant wind study

The first study is done with a constant wind speed. Then add meters and channels in order to visualize the following values: Alpha, Idc, Idc2, Pgrid, Qgrid, V_DCbus. • Simulation parameters: • Duration: 40 s • Time step: 100µs • Plot step: 1000µs • Startup Method: Standard The results are the following :

Figure 37: constant_wind_study results

• Analysis: The generator voltage increases according to the speed. When Vdv reaches 1440 V, the DC bus regulation is activated and the alpha drive maintains the voltage between 1520V and 1680 V. Once Vdv reaches 1520V, the inverter is unlocked, and Idc2 flows from the DC-bus to the grid.The alpha angle varies according to the measured voltage. We measure 1.6MW for the output active power and no reactive power owing to the capacitors

Fault Analysis

The connection of a distributed generator to a radial distribution system leads to situations not normally supported by the network in case of faults. The distribution network is a radial network and the protections are based on the current measurement. The distribution system is the same as before. The faults are simulated with the two following components which can be found in the folder "Master Library/Faults:

A->G

Timed Fault Logic

This simulation consists of connecting the distributed generator at one node and the fault component at another node. Then, the current and the active power are measured in order to determine the protection level necessary and compared to the values measured without the wind turbine generator.

The peak values at Node 1 is lower with DG than without DG. Thus: 1) The detection level must be below the smallest value (but above the normal consumption value). 2) The current at normal condition without DG must not reach the detection level, or the grid manager must know when the DG is on-line or off-line to modify the protection level.

During a fault, the current at I3 flows in the other direction with DG (the active power is negative). If there is a power protection at this point, this protection will see a negative active power and thus, it will never act! The distributed generator fault current will never be stopped. The peak value at I3 is greater with DG. This could cause a serious problem if the new and larger I3 exceeds the circuit breaker maximum interrupting rating. In this case the circuit breaker must be changed.

9.3

Conclusion

The connection of a wind turbine cannot be done directly. The distribution grid is a radial grid and the connection of a distributed generator can modify many uses and controls. Therefore, a complete study must be done because the implementation of a distributed generator will change the protections and circuit breakers needed.

Main Simulation parameters: • Duration: 250 s • Time step: 100 µs • Plot Step : 10 000µs Curves and Analysis:

Figure 51: dyn_pitch.psc results

The beta regulation is aimed at limiting the turbine power at the rated values. We can see that when the turbine power becomes higher than 3.6MW, beta increases, Cp decreases and the output power decreases. The DC bus regulation is still activated when Vdv reaches 1440 V and then, power is delivered to the grid and Alpha varies according to the measured voltage. When the wind decreases, beta decreases in order to increase the input mechanical power, but when the wind decreases too much, Vdv becomes lower than 1440V and the inverter is locked. At the end of the simulation, the turbine power turns negative; this means that the wind turbine is driven by the inertia of the synchronous generator .

10.2

Passive pitch control simulation

In passive pitch control mode, blades are specifically conceived to catch the maximum power until a fixed limit. Above this limit, there are turbulences on the blades and the wind speed is seen as if it was constant for the turbine. Here, the chosen optimal wind speed is 13 m/s. Thus, in this simulation, Beta is set to 0 in order to get the maximum power under 13m/s, above the nominal speed (13 m/s), turbulence is simulated by stopping the wind speed from increasing. This is modeled with a "hard limiter" component defined as shown below:

The scheme of the wind turbine subpages looks like the following figure:

The wind is modelled with a sinusoidal function between the limits of 4m/s and 13m/s. Compared with the previous simulation, we can observe that the beta regulation does not act, thus, the turbine power coefficient is only a wind speed and a hub speed function.

Comparison of passive and dynamic pitch control

You can see a comparison of power produced by the same wind turbine generator in passive pitch control mode and dynamic pitch control mode. You can directly perform such comparison in "Livewire":

Figure 55: Comparison between pitch control modes

On these curves, it is easy to see that the pitch regulation tries to maintain the turbine power at its rated value ( 3.6MW) whereas, without dynamic pitch control, the turbine power is not optimized for an entire range of wind speed. Therefore, the energy received in the grid is much larger in dynamic pitch control mode. A wind turbine with dynamic pitch control is more expensive than a passive pitch control, but each time the wind speed is above its rated value, you can get more energy. These simulations would be a reliable basis for the technical-economic study concerning the choice of the pitch control mode.

11. Wind farm

Previously, we simulated a single 3MVA wind turbine. Now we will connect an entire wind farm composed of 100 wind turbines representing a power of 300 MVA, which equals the rated power of the main source of the distribution grid. With connection to the grid power, the output power can no longer be neglected. Therefore, two conditions must be respected at the connection point in order not to cause the grid to become unstable: • the voltage must be 1 p.u. The voltage regulation must be directly inserted at the connection point. • the frequency of the inverter must be locked on the grid frequency. In general, a Phase Lock Loop (PLL) is used.

Overvoltage protection

The rated value of the DC voltage is: V_DCbus = (3*Vn*√6) / π = (3*690*√6) / π = 1600 V The output voltage of a generator is proportional to its speed. The speed of the generator not being controlled, the DC bus must be protected from over-voltage. With a secure margin of 10%: Maximum voltage = 1.1*1600 = 1760 V To secure the bus, it is possible to block the rectifier in case of over-voltage. This is done with the Single Input Level Comparator. This component can be found in the folder "Master Library/CSMF".

Build the DC bus

1) Storage capacitance: The energy stored in the DC bus must tolerate voltage sags of 1 second. The energy stored must be W = Pn*1s= 3MJ. E = ½ * C * V_DCbus 2 V_DCbus = 1600 V C = 2*W / V_DCbus 2 = 2*3*1e6 / 16002 = 2.3 f 2) Resistor: The capacitor can be modelled as a short-circuit when it is discharged; thus we must include a resistor in order to limit the current peak to its rated value when the capacitor is at low charge. V_DCbus =Vres+Vcap ≈ V res at low charge R = V_DCbus / In = 1600 / 1450 = 1.1 Ω 3) Breaker: The system is a first order one; its load time constant is Tr = 3 * τ (τ = RC) Tr = 3* RC = 3*1.1*2.3 = 7.5 s This resistor must be shunted after 7.5s in order to limit the Joule losses. A single_phase breaker will be used to shunt the resistor (this component can be found in the folder "Master Library/Breakers").

The motor torque is always higher than the resistive torque so that the speed increases.As speed increases, Cp decreases so that the turbine power and the turbine torque decreases. At t=7.5s, the resistance is shunted, the capacitor is charged, the over-voltage regulation limits the bus voltage at 1760 V and Idc goes to 0 so that the delivered output power of the generator becomes 0.

Presentation

In this study, the modeled inverter is a current inverter with thyristors (monodirectional in current, bi-directional in voltage). An inductor is added in order to model a current source at the input of the inverter. • Inductor:

The energy in the DC bus must be enough to bear a voltage sag of 1 second W = 3 000 000 J. The energy stored in a self-inductor is W = ½ * L *Idc2 Because Idc = Pdc/Vdv = 3*1e6/1600 = 1875 A L = 2*E / Idc2 = 2*3000000 / 18752 = 1.7 H Select an inductor and paste it your model. • Inverter:

As for the rectifier, in order to obtain a thyristor current inverter, please select the 6 pulse bridge component. Characterize it as shown in the following figure:

Voltage collapse limitation

The bus must be protected from short-circuit in case of fault on the distribution network; otherwise, the voltage will collapse. As for the overvoltage limitation, the secure margin is about 10%. Low voltage limitation=0.9*1600 = 1440 V To secure the bus, we will stop the rectifier in case of low-voltage. This is done with the Single input level comparator component, define it as shown in the following figure:

Voltage regulation

At that point, one single wind turbine is modelled. The weak impact of the turbine to the network make that the voltage control will be done at the DC bus and not directly at the connection point. One define that the fluctuation of the DC bus voltage must remain between 0.95 p.u. and 1.05p.u: o Vdv-5% < V_Dcbus < Vdv+5% o 1520 V < V_Dcbus < 1680 V This control will be performed with HVDC control system components available in the PSCAD Master library (under HVDC, FACTS & Power Electronics) : o "Voltage Dependent current limits" o "Generic current controller", • Voltage Dependent Current Limits:

User defines two voltage values between which to maintain the DC voltage. These values are called "Applying Limit" (Von) and "Removing Limit" (Voff). The user also enters a minimum value for the current, called "Current Limit", and then: • if VD >"Removing Limit" : Current Order CO= Current Input CI • if VD < "Applying Limit" : Current Order CO= Current Limit Then, 2 option exists to provide either a hysteresis type characteristic between the Von and Voff or a straight line sloping characteristic between the two levels.

Connection to the network

Place the following elements in your system:

•

Capacitors:

Capacitors are added at the output to smooth output voltages and compensate for output reactive power. The simulation allows us to dimension the capacitor: With C=2 mf per capacitor, the reactive power injected to the grid is null. •

Transformer:

In order to connect the inverter output to the grid a transformer is necessary to adapt the voltage level. Voltage level at the output of the inverter: The current is Ieff-fond = Idc*√6 /π We consider that there are no losses in the inverter: P = 3*V*Ieff-fond cosϕ = Vdv*Idc⇔3*V*Idc*cosϕ*√6 /π = Vdv*Idc⇒V= π*Vdv/(3*√6*cosϕ) The currents in the thyristor must be ahead of the voltage, so in order to have a secure margin, we choose ϕ = π/4: V = 968 V and U = 1675V

This component can be found in the folder "Master Library/Machines". The Wind Source component simulates every wind condition: • mean wind speed • periodic gust with a sinus form • ramp • noise • damper for all the preceding conditions For wind turbine, the three following wind characteristics are important: • The mean wind speed: The rated characteristics of the turbine and the generator are determined according to the mean wind speed. Economic studies are also based on this speed. In general, the mean wind speed is approximately 13 m/s. • The cut-in speed: At speeds higher than the cut-in speed, mechanical brakes are released in order to let the turbine turn. In general, the cut-in speed is equal to 4 m/s. • The cut-out speed: At speeds higher than the cut-out speed, the turbine rotation is stopped in order not to damage the blades of the turbine. In general, the cut-out speed is approximately 25 m/s. For dynamic simulations, the wind speed is simulated throughout a day; thus, the wind speed must vary from the cut-in speed to the cut-out speed in order to study the wind turbine's reaction for all wind conditions. In this study, a startup below the cut-in speed and a stop above the cut-out speed are not considered; the wind speed is limited to between 4m/s and 25m/s. First, we will consider a constant wind at 13m/s. Copy a wind source component in your project and parameterize it as shown in Figure 1:

The kinetic energy of the air through the rotor blades is: Ec = ½ m Ws2 The theoretical power we can obtain from a wind turbine is: Pth = ½ ρ S Ws 3 with ρ = air density (1.22 kg/m3) S = rotor surface (m2 ) Ws = Wind speed (m/s) In practice, the power is smaller because the wind speed behind the hub is not 0. This efficiency is characterized by the Betz coefficient (given by Bernouilli's equations), also called the Power Coefficient Cp: Cp= Preal/Pth Cp = ½ (1-a2) (1+a) a = Wind speed behind the rotor / wind speed in front of the rotor

The regulation of β enables the regulation of Cp and thus enables to control the output power of the turbine depending on wind conditions. Two regulation strategies exists and are described below: • Passive pitch control: The β angle is determined by the wind turbine builder to produce maximum energy for a predefined average speed. Below the mean wind speed, there is no angle control: Cp is not maximum. Above the mean wind speed, the blade profile creates turbulence in order to keep the rotation of the blades from increasing. • Dynamic pitch control: In this configuration, the blades can turn around their longitudinal axis. A power reference for the regulation system is given, and at each second the system turns the blades in order to regulate the output power as shown on the following curve:

The evolution of curves follows the fundamental mechanical law: • Turbine Torque - Electromagnetic Torque = J*dw/dt + f*w during the starting, the Turbine torque is > To the Electromagnetic Torque: Speed increases. • Turbine power is managed by the Cp value, which is a wind speed and a hub speed function. In this example the wind speed is constant (13 m/s), thus, Cp is only a hub speed function. As the speed increases, the power coefficient Cp = 0.5(γ - 0.022β2 -5.6) e-0.17γ decreases. Turbine power decreases • Final steady state : Turbine Torque - Electromagnetic Torque = f*w Tturb = 1 173 000 Nm TelecGene = 1 156 000 Nm f*w = 1 173 000 - 1 156 000 = 17 000 Nm w = 3.06 rad/s and f = 0.02 pu = 0.02 * 955000 = 19100 Nm f*w = 19100 * 3.06 / 3.14 = 18 600 Nm ≅17000 Nm • • • The turbine power corresponds to the rated power (3.6 MW) The generator power starts from 0 to the turbine rated power The speed is approximately the rated speed (3.06 rad/s)

PART A: INTRODUCTION Introduction

1. Introduction

Recently, wind power generation has attracted special interest, and many wind power stations are in service throughout the world. In wind power stations, induction machines are often used as generators, but the development of new permanent magnet generators, the improvement of the ACDC-AC conversion and its advantages for output power quality make other solutions possible. A recent solution is to use a permanent magnet generator with variable speed and a conversion stage, which is the case studied in this technical paper. The aim of this tutorial is to familiarize users with PSCAD software through a complete example. PSCAD contains powerful tools for the wind turbine simulation. Part B describes the step-by-step building of the entire energy generation cycle for one wind turbine. All components are dimensioned and connected to each other. Intermediate simulations validate the model. In Part C, different power turbine regulation types are simulated and analyzed, and fault situations on the grid are studied. Finally, an entire wind farm is modelled.

PSCAD components

In PSCAD, the complete wind generator cycle is composed of : The wind source component:
ES Wind Source Mean Gust Ramp Vw

•
Vw W

The mechanical turbine, represented by a component called "wind turbine".
Wind Turbine MOD 2 Type Tm P

Beta

•

The regulation governor of the turbine's output power. This regulation can be passive (passive pitch control) or dynamic (dynamic pitch control). The difference is whether or not the blades turn around their longitudinal axis. Both kinds of regulation can be simulated by a component called "Wind turbine governor".
Beta Wind Turbine Governor MOD 2 Type

Wm Pg

•

The other components are standard ones: synchronous machine, transformer, rectifier, inverter, Control System, Modelling Functions (CSMF), ... . All these components will be detailed in Part B.

Modelled structure

Part B contains: • A theoretical study of wind turbine generation • The dimensioning of each PSCAD component with intermediate simulations in order to compare results with the theory and to validate the model. This paper makes the choice to define a wind turbine connected to a permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator with 100 pole pairs. The connection to the grid is then performed through a full AC/DC/AC converter and a step up transformer. The main advantage of this strategy is to allow to remove the gear box in the wind turbine. Of course different technologies can be fully simulated in PSCAD: o Induction generatore direct connection o Doubly Fed Induction Generator Some examples of the implementation of this models in PSCAD can be asked to CEDRAT or your local PSCAD distributor. In this document, the overall sequence can be summarized by the following diagram:
