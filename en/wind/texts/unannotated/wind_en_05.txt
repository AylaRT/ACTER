TITLE OF REPORT Assessment of Potential Improvements in Large-Scale Low Wind Speed Technology ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS IN LARGE-SCALE LOW WIND SPEED TECHNOLOGY global windpower 2004 mARCH 29, 2004 10:40am - 12:00pm Improvements in blade and low wind speed technology technical track joseph m. cohen Princeton Energy Resources International 1700 Rockville Pike, Suite 550 Rockville, MD 20852 jcohen@perihq.com www.perihq.com ABSTRACT A probabilistic methodology is presented to examine technology advances in large-scale, low wind speed turbines over the next 10 years. The paper first presents a reference set of performance and capital and operating cost characteristics for wind plants, using a composite of leading-edge 2002 technology. It next defines a set of Technology Improvement Opportunities (TIO) that may lead to lower levelized cost of energy (COE). A preliminary set of quantitative estimates of improvements to COE equation inputs (e.g., turbine cost, net annual energy) are made for each TIO. Results are then presented from a probabilistic approach to evaluating COEs for possible turbine technology configurations, or "pathways," resulting from successful implementation of all possible combinations of those improvements. This approach captures the uncertainty of both R&D outcomes (potential sizes of various improvements) and the probability of achieving any improvement, (R&D "success"), regardless of the improvement size. INTRODUCTION The President's Management Agenda requires that government organizations adopt and maintain a strong focus on achieving results, and not on just carrying out processes. The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Wind Energy Research Program has responded to this requirement by developing a program planning tool that prioritizes program activities, and assesses their continuing contribution to the achievement of program goals. The program pursues this Management Agenda through two parallel activities. First, the Program has an on-going Technical Assessment activity - to monitor the current status of wind technology and progress in achieving program cost goals, to evaluate that status within the context of the needs of the marketplace, and to identify technological pathways that will lead to wind's successful competition in the marketplace. Second, the Program also uses a formal Peer Review process - to benefit from the guidance of industry and the research community, and to provide an outside view of the program. Technical Assessment and Peer Review provide inputs that the Program Management Team considers in making decisions about strategic program directions and funding priorities. The Program goal for low wind speed technology is to achieve 3 ¢/kWh in land-based class 4 wind sites (5.8 m/s at 10 m above ground) and 5¢/kWh in class 4 shallow water offshore sites by 2012. At the core of the strategic planning framework is a Wind Technology Pathways Model developed by Princeton Energy Resources International, LLC, (PERI), under subcontract to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). An important objective of the pathways model is to demonstrate that there are sufficient opportunities for wind technology to be improved, through program-sponsored R&D, such that the goals of the program can, in fact, be achieved. A second objective of the pathways model is to explore the implications of program success in meeting goals if a particular research project does not yield the expected technology improvement benefits. This paper represents the views of the author and does not necessarily state or reflect those of the United States government or any agency thereof. TECHNOLOGY PATHWAYS ANALYSIS The technology pathways analysis can be described as a 5-step process, as shown in Figure 1. The overall metric used by the Program to set goals for technology improvements, and to track subsequent progress in R&D towards those goals, is the levelized cost of energy (COE). Cost levelization is the conversion of a stream of varying actual annual project costs to a stream of equal (level) annual costs that has the same present value as the present value of the actual cost stream. COE depends partly on values for annual energy capture, and wind plant initial capital cost and annual expenses, including operation and maintenance costs, sinking fund payments for periodic (long-term) replacements or major component overhauls, land lease payments, and other expenses such as taxes and insurance. Calculation of COE also involves assumptions for several financial factors such as the cost of money, required investor rates of return, project debt-to-equity ratios and other lender requirements, the assumed project operational life, and the annual wind energy available at the site. While not included in the pathways analysis, federal and state incentives and the delivery point for electricity can also significantly affect the COE. A full discussion of the COE methodology and assumptions may be found in Attachment C of the NREL Low Wind Speed Turbine (LWST) Project solicitation, October 2001. FIGURE 1. WIND TECHNOLOGY PATH ANALYSIS PROCESS COE in the pathways analysis is expressed in constant, January 2002 dollars. It is calculated for a 100 MW (rated) wind power plant, with an expected life of 30 years, and a class 4 wind resource (assumes 5.8 m/sec at 10 meters above ground, a wind shear exponent of 0.14, and a Rayleigh distribution, i.e., a Weibull k factor = 2 ) using the following equation: COE = (FCR x ICC) + AOE AEP where: COE ( Levelized Cost of Energy ($/kWh) (constant dollar) FCR ( Fixed Charge Rate (constant dollar) = (0.1158) ICC ( Initial Capital Cost (overnight $) = [Turbine Capital Cost (TCC) + Balance of Station Cost (BOS)] AEP ( Net Annual Energy Production (kWh/yr) AOE ( Annual Operating Expenses ( LLC+ (O&M + LRC) AEP LLC ( Land Lease Cost ($/kWh) O&M ( After-tax, Levelized O&M Cost ($/yr multiplied by (1- tax rate = 0.60) LRC ( Levelized Major Replacement and Overhaul Cost ($/yr) The initial capital cost is an overnight cost, i.e., it does not include construction financing, which typically adds between 50 $/kW and 100 $/kW. The Fixed Charge Rate is the annual amount per dollar of Initial Capital Cost needed to cover the capital cost, a return on debt and equity, and various other fixed charges. This rate is imputed from a hypothetical project, assuming Generation Company (GenCo), or balance sheet, financing, modeled with PERI's FATE2-P pro forma cash flow spreadsheet model. Specifically, it includes construction financing, financing fees, return on debt and equity, depreciation, income tax, property tax and insurance. For the COE calculations, an imputed constant dollar FCR = 0.1158 was used. The 10-year Section 45 Renewable Energy Production Tax Credit is not included in the Fixed Charge Rate. To allow tracking of technology advances absent from changes in financial parameters and other assumptions, the following are treated as the only input variables in the COE equation for the Turbine Pathways analysis; all other inputs and assumptions are fixed: Turbine Capital Cost (TCC) Balance of Station Cost (BOS) Annual Operation and Maintenance Cost (O&M) Levelized Replacement and Overhaul Cost (LRC) Net Annual Energy Production (AEP) Readers are cautioned that the COE calculated for this analysis is not the same value as the COE that would be calculated in the current market. First, commercial COEs are stated in current dollars, which include the effects of inflation, making the commercial COE typically about 0.5 ¢/kWh to 1 ¢/kWh higher than the constant dollar equivalent. Second, the federal Production Tax Credit (1.8 ¢/kWh for the first 10 years) is not included. Third, the FCR assumes a relatively high required rate of return compared to current market rates and is therefore higher than one might use to characterize COE in the current financial climate. However, it is reasonable given historical experience, and consistent with the goal of this analysis - to track and project changes in COE resulting from technology development, not financial conditions. The reader is also cautioned that the levelized COEis not the same as a bid price, which might include escalators. Step 1 - Characterize Reference Turbine In order to project improvements in cost, performance, and reliability on wind turbine systems and wind plants using the pathways model, a baseline, or reference, set of cost and performance characteristics for the five variables listed above must first be developed. These characteristics serve as the inputs to a reference COE from which all technical improvements are measured. The reference technology characteristics for DOE's ongoing low wind speed technology pathways analysis efforts were derived primarily from the baseline turbine design developed under the recent WindPACT (Wind Partnership for Advanced Component Technologies) project.[1] That baseline represented a composite of the most advanced wind energy technology available in 2002. Nominally, it represents a 3-bladed, up-wind, variable pitch, variable speed turbine using a doubly-fed generator rated at 1,500 kW. The rotor diameter is 70 meters and the tower height is 65 meters. The reference characteristics are also consistent with several leading commercial turbines from the major manufacturers in 2002. That date was selected as the reference because it is when the DOE Low Wind Speed Turbine Program was initiated. Because the purpose of the pathways analysis is to examine leading edge technology, it is important that the reference turbine represent the current status of such technology. The analysis characterizes costs assuming a 100 MW wind plant, to take advantage of economies of scale in procurement and installation. Analysis of 22 confidential power purchase agreements for projects installed over the past 6 years shows a strong correlation between project size and capital cost. Further, cost estimates assume favorable installation and maintenance conditions consistent with large areas of class 4 winds in the United States (i.e., relatively flat land, easy access, and soils conducive to foundations and large installation cranes). Together, these assumptions create a capital cost estimate towards the lower end of the range typically reported for commercial projects. Table 1 summarizes estimated input data for the reference wind COE calculation. Data are shown as a range from minimum to maximum, with an expected value in-between. Those three data points create a triangular distribution for each variable, as illustrated in Figure 2. The wind pathways analysis model uses a Monte Carlo sampling approach to randomly sample, and then combine the resulting values from, each input distribution in the COE equation. The model performs this sampling exercise over a large number of iterations to create a distribution of all possible resulting values. Using the inputs from table 1, the model calculates a reference wind turbine project with a mean (i.e., 50% chance) COE of 4.7 ¢/kWh, or 4.8 ¢/kWh at a 65% level of probability. Step 2 - Identify Technology Improvement Opportunities (TIOs) As an initial test of the wind path analysis tool, National Wind Technology Center (NWTC) research staff identified a set of technological improvements that are expected to contribute to the technology's becoming more cost effective by 2012. These have been termed the Technology Improvement Opportunities (TIO). Wind turbine design is a matter of constant tradeoff between the competing demands of lower cost, greater energy productivity, increased lifetime and durability, and maintenance cost. Achieving greater energy production may cost more, or it may cost less. Reducing materials to reduce capital investment may adversely affect O&M costs. These are the designers' tradeoffs, and they are captured in the model. However, the model does not currently perform detailed system tradeoffs itself. It can include any number of independent technology design paths, but tradeoffs between components within a system must currently be treated in the estimation of the input parameters. A preliminary set of TIOS is listed in Figure 3. TABLE 1. REFERENCE (2002) WIND TURBINE AND PLANT CHARACTERISTICS FIGURE 2. EXAMPLE COE INPUT DISTRIBUTIONS FIGURE 3. PRELIMINARY TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITIES TIO 1. Advanced (enlarged) Rotors - Some of the most dramatic reductions in cost of energy are expected to derive from sophisticated new rotor designs. In the near term, turbines will employ advanced control systems specifically developed to reduce structural loads. By this means, larger rotors can be mated to existing tower and chassis designs. (In fact manufacturers have already begun to achieve this from their 2002 designs.) The consequence of this approach is an appreciable increase in annual energy production (AEP) on the order of 10%, but with only a minimal increase in turbine capital cost (TCC), on the order of 1%. Virtually none of these advanced concepts can evolve without concurrent advances in control strategy and implementation. For example, extendable rotors, where diameter varies with inflow conditions, use blade length as a control variable in addition to torque and rotor speed. Adaptive or predictive control systems, perhaps using embedded sensors or micro-mechanical devices, may need to monitor several control inputs while simultaneously monitoring system health. From a better understanding of aeroelasticity, designers have devised ways to fabricate adaptive composite blades to reduce structural loads. New materials, such as carbon fiber or hybrid carbon/glass composites are likely to be applied. An integrated design process requiring the simultaneous optimization of performance, noise, controls, aeroelastics, and structural dynamics will allow these advanced rotors to materialize. A direct benefit is reduced structural weight, but the most promising implementation is increased energy capture through increased swept area. Several recent reports sponsored by the DOE Wind Enegy Program contain information on potential improvements in rotors. [2] [3] TIO 2. Manufacturing - R&D in the area of manufacturing methods will enable designers to improve the performance-per-unit-cost of wind turbines. As new materials are part of TIO 1, moving towards blades that are both stiffer and stronger to span greater areas, and also lighter and adaptive to reduce system loads, will also require improved manufacturing processes. Since blades control all of the energy capture and almost all of the loads, they are the primary target of materials, manufacturing, and fatigue research. Tools that predict how materials work within design details will assist in improving the tailoring of design practices to take into account material interactions, property variability, and specified design loads. Detailed designs of specific components will be better integrated into system codes for full structural dynamics and performance evaluation. In addition to the technology manufacturing and design improvements discussed above, there have been recent indications from several sources that manufacturer's markup may be expected to decrease in the future. Several factors may contribute to narrower margins, including lower uncertainty and risk with mature products. In addition, price pressure from competition and higher sales volume from larger, more expensive machines are expected to result in smaller margins. There have been many reports published by the Program that support the potential for advances in this TIO. Some of these are listed in the reference section. [4] [5] [6] [7] TIO 3. Reduced Energy Losses and Increased Availability - In calculating COE, the energy converted by the rotor is multiplied by a factor to account for various energy losses. These losses are the result of blade soiling from dirt and insects, interference among turbines in arrays, imperfect controls for tracking the wind or maintaining rotor speed, and downtime from unexpected or unavoidable events. With improvements in design capability and operating experience, these losses are expected to decrease. In addition, advances in health monitoring techniques utilizing telemetry or other communications systems will allow problems to be diagnosed before costly repairs are necessary. Improvements in extended scheduled maintenance will reduce costs for O&M trips, especially for offshore turbines. TIO 4. Advanced Towers - In most locations, the wind speed increases with height above the ground according to a power law function. Unfortunately, tower costs also rise with height, and do so exponentially. Furthermore, the cost of cranes to install and service turbines on tall towers can become prohibitive. Now that the design and installation of robust wind turbine towers are refined engineering disciplines, the awareness that significantly greater energy capture is the reward of taller towers has focused designers on innovative concepts to address these issues. Technology that has been used for years on smokestacks and water towers, for example, is being evaluated for use on wind turbines. Hybrid towers of tubular steel atop concrete bases are an option, as are self-erecting designs of several types. These concepts may be viewed as "enabling" technology for towers of 100 m and taller. Reducing the cost of construction, installation, or the towers themselves permits the exploitation of more energetic winds with no increase in land or transmission costs. While taller towers entail increases in Turbine Capital Cost (TCC), the effect of this increased cost is more than offset by the expected increase in energy capture, even at moderate wind sites. Furthermore, self-erecting towers will provide an appreciable, though currently inestimable, reduction in maintenance costs. Recent WindPACT studies provide further information on possible advances in this area. [8] [9] TIO 5. Site-Specific Design/Reduced Design Margin - Most wind turbines are designed to International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) specifications for structural adequacy and system safety. The requirements depend upon site characteristics such as annual average wind speed and inflow turbulence. Recent studies indicate that turbines designed for standard IEC class definitions may be very far off optimum in some applications. This is particularly true for low wind speed sites, where varying levels of COE reductions are possible depending upon whether specific components are purpose-designed or there is a complete, special-purpose, system design. While it is not yet clear which projects warrant site-specific design, the approach is expected to be appropriate for some of the very large projects currently envisioned. In the current COE calculations, we characterize the wind site as having an annual average wind speed of 5.8 m/s measured at a height of 10 m above ground. Wind speed is assumed to increase using a power law exponent applied to the ratio of hub height to the reference height. An exponent of 1/7 is often used for COE calculations. However, it is well known that there are many sites in the U.S. with more favorable wind shear characteristics. There are also sites with more favorable distributions of wind speed about the mean - they are skewed toward higher wind speeds. Consequently, in addition to the benefits of specially designed wind turbines, deployment at these energetic wind sites will also expected to occur. To accommodate the somewhat greater fatigue loads associated with operation at higher mean wind speed, a modest increase in turbine capital cost may be expected. TIO 6. New Drive Train Concepts - Several wind turbine design teams are evaluating promising new drive train concepts. Many different approaches are proposed, including highly integrated systems, permanent magnet generators and multi-generator configurations. In some cases, the drive train also has a favorable impact on chassis and nacelle integration. The important common attribute of these disparate systems is the ability to reduce both initial drive train cost and long-term replacement cost by 20% to 45%. The anticipated COE increments include the effects of component efficiencies and of advanced power electronics appropriate for the particular drive train concept. The DOE program has recently published a reports discussing potential advances in drive trains. [10] [11] TIO 7. Advanced Power Electronics - The January 2002 baseline is a variable speed turbine using a wound rotor generator with power conditioning of approximately 30% of its output. Future turbines are also expected to be variable speed designs. It is likely that some of them will employ direct-drive, permanent magnet generators, which enable elimination of conventional gearboxes by controlling shaft speed and torque electrically instead of mechanically. Due to those control requirements, such turbines require power conditioning of 100% of their output. In addition to the cost and efficiency improvements of the power electronics, additional cost reductions are expected in subsequent years. These will result from learning experience, as well as improved components and circuit design. TIO 8. Learning Curve Effects - An accepted phenomenon is that the cost of manufacturing products decreases with increased cumulative production volume. This learning effect results from better tooling and assembly procedures, value engineering, competition among suppliers, and general learning experience. It does not include technology advances from R&D or volume discounts from larger annual or bulk purchases. The rate of reduction is usually characterized by a "learning rate," or percentage reduction in cost, for every doubling of cumulative capacity. A conservative approach to estimating cost reductions from learning is to assume a range of market growth rates (say, one or two doublings of cumulative capacity by 2012) and a range of small decreases in the learning rate, based on the maturity of the wind technology product and industry, and historical experience with analogous products and industries. Step 3. Estimate TIO Effects The left side of Figure 4 shows a range of preliminary estimates for improvements in COE inputs from the various TIOs. In the same way that reference COE inputs were developed using triangular distributions, NWCT staff developed triangular distributions for COE improvements for each TIO based on LWST proposals, WindPACT studies, research reports, and expert knowledge. (Note that Turbine Capital Costs (TCC) and Balance of Station Costs (BOS) have been combined in the "Capital Cost" category in the figure.) The bars on the figure show the minimum and maximum of the triangular distribution. If desired, the model can use other distributions to match special insights one might have on any of the input variables. The COE improvement estimates for each TIO are currently undergoing extensive revision and new results are expected later this year. As such, Figure 4 should be considered only illustrative of the technology pathway inputs and analysis results. It is only partially complete in terms of the numerical estimates, as well as the indications of which COE inputs are impacted by each TIO. The left side of the figure also contains a column for "Probabilities of Success" that characterizes the chances that improvements of any size will be achieved in each TIO. That is, the model first accounts for the probability that "success" is achieved, and if is, then the resulting improvements will fall within the range identified by data bars in the figure. The bars therefore reflect the inherent uncertainty in knowing the value of future improvements. FIGURE 4. PRELIMINARY PATH ANALYSIS IMPROVMENTS AND RESULTS Step 4. Perform Analysis To illustrate how the model works in its simplest form, assume that there are only two TIOs. The first reduces capital cost by 10% and also increases energy production by 5%. The second, which is totally independent of the first, reduces cost by another 7%, but produces 4% less energy (a cost-effective trade-off). Simply adding the two together gives the outcome that cost is reduced by 17% and energy production is increased by 1%. Because cost of energy is proportional to capital cost and inversely proportional to energy production, the COE reduction from these two TIOs would be (1-0.17)/(1+0.01), or 17.8%. In fact, the model represents the output range as a probability distribution around a most likely value, in the same way that it represents the inputs as probability ranges. The model can account for any potential interactions among the different TIOs. In contrast to the simple example just discussed, the model adds the potential changes probabilistically, and produces a range of potential outcomes for cost, energy production, and O&M. This probabilistic treatment is illustrated in Figure 5. The model further accounts for the variety of technology configurations that might be used to achieve progress (e.g., through different gearbox designs). The model's ability to analyze the variety of approaches to meeting goals is what makes it a true "pathways" model. To illustrate, all turbines require a tower and rotor; but different tower designs could be married to different rotor designs, and still achieve the same level of cost-effectiveness. These combinations can be thought of as competing pathways. It is critical that the DOE Program be able to represent the fact that there are many potential approaches to meeting goals, that some are riskier than others, and that some might potentially yield a higher level of improvement in exchange for that additional technological risk. Step 5. Review Results The right side of Figure 4 shows the resulting ranges for COE input improvements (top of graphic), and subsequent reduction of COE itself (bottom of graphic). The figure shows that, while there is a very small chance that COE could be improved by as little as 20%, or as much as 50%, there is a 60% chance that it will be improved by 37% from the reference to a value of 3 ¢/kWh, i.e., (4.8-3)/4.8 = 37%. CONCLUSIONS As part of the DOE Wind Energy Program's overall program planning and management requirements, a methodology has been developed to assess the potential improvements to low wind speed turbine technology. The methodology accounts for both the probability of success of R&D efforts to achieve technology improvements, and the inherent uncertainty associated with the values of those improvements. Reference turbine cost and performance characteristics, representing year 2002 leading-edge technology, were developed that result in a mean constant dollar levelized cost of energy of 4.7 ¢/kWh, or 4.8 ¢/kWh with a probability of 65%. NWTC and Sandia staff have developed a preliminary set of Technology Improvement Opportunities (TIOs) that describe the areas for potential improvements to low wind speed turbine technology between 2002 and 2012. Program researchers have also partially developed a preliminary list of improvements to COE inputs for each TIO. Using that set of improvement values in a test run, the wind technology path model resulted in a projection of a levelized cost of energy (COE) in year 2012 of 3 ¢/kWh at a 60% level of probability. The Wind Program plans to conduct an update of the COE input improvement values for each TIO as part of its annual program planning and assessment cycle during 2004. Updated results, detailing both the sources for COE improvements and their corresponding values, will be reported from that activity.
