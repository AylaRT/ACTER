Instructor needs to research the effects of global warming and demonstrate these effects on the environment. Instructor will need to show statistical data from independent and government agencies on the offsets of pollution created by wind power and other alternative energy solutions. Recommended Instructor/Student In-class/lab Activity Methods to: Identify the 'pioneers' of wind energy over the last 100 years, and compare that to the last 30 years of development and technology jumps in the industry. Develop a technology growth time line with the different styles, and models, and capacities. Have the students identify and match these items. Show examples of different types of wind turbines, i.e. Direct drive Two bladed Single blade Lattice tower and tube tower Early 150 kW machine vs. 1 Megawatt plus machines. On shore vs. off shore. Discuss the price comparisons of wind verses gas, thermal, hydro, etc. Talk in detail about the positive contributors of wind in industrial and individual applications in specific areas around the world. In Europe with both off shore and on shore wind projects, wind energy is producing well over 50 to 60 % of countries energy needs. In the United States large farms are producing X amount of energy for large cities and areas like California and Texas. In the United States, in the Midwest, turbines are placed on farm land and the farmers are benefiting not only from crop production, but turbine production with a very small foot print on the land. In rural areas without mainstream industry supporting communities, large wind parks can bring employment and business to local businesses improving local economies. Manufactures, shipping, trucking, crane services, operators, concrete companies, heavy equipment companies, lubricant and oil manufactures, contactors, etc, all benefit from wind. In the United States alone wind has contributed to X jobs. Turbines give off no emissions. There is only a fraction of waste from wind turbines, and most of that waste is none hazardous. With turbines running in rural type areas, local and state gas power plants do not need to run as much and that in turn reduces emissions and pollutants, Communities have positive responses to wind plants due to cleaner energy without polluting the air.
