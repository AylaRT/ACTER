GENERAL PROVISIONS A. Title . These regulations shall officially be known, cited and referred to as the Wind Energy Conversion Systems (WECS) Ordinance of the Town of Ridgeville, and hereinafter will be referred to as "The Ordinance." B. Findings . Under state law, electric generating facilities of less than 100 megawatts ("MW") are subject to regulations enacted by counties and local units of government. The Town of Ridgeville is under the Monroe County Zoning and Wind Energy System Ordinance, which regulates such facilities. However, the Monroe County Zoning and Wind Energy System Ordinance has insufficient standards to protect the public health and safety of the residents and property owners of the Town of Ridgeville. Therefore, this Town of Ridgeville licensing ordinance has been adopted under the Town of Ridgeville's town and village powers and Wis. Stat. § 66.0401. The Town finds that Wind Energy Systems which may be constructed and operated in the Town require special licensing by the Town in addition to any restrictions that may be imposed by Monroe County, in order to protect the public health and safety of Town residents and property owners. In this regard, the Town finds that the report issued by the National Research Council entitled Environmental Impacts of Wind-Energy Projects , May 2007 ("2007 NRC Report"), addresses several important public health and safety issues relative to WECS that require regulation by the Town. The Town further finds that the provisions of the "Draft Model Wind Ordinance for Wisconsin," as promoted by the State of Wisconsin's Department of Administration, are inadequate to reasonably protect public health and safety. C. Purposes and I ntent . The purposes and intent of this Ordinance are to protect the public health and safety of the residents and property owners of the Town of Ridgeville who may be affected by the development and operation of WECS. Such purposes and intent shall be accomplished by regulating noise, protecting emergency communications, regulating shadow flicker, ensuring adequate fire protection, establishing adequate setbacks, protecting water quality, preventing soil erosion, regulating visual obstructions, preventing conflicts between incompatible land uses, ensuring proper installation of WECS, and ensuring safe and complete decommissioning of WECS.

For purposes of this escalator clause, the Consumer Price Index means the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Statistics, Consumer Price Index for the United States, All Urban Consumers, all items, unadjusted index. B. Property Taxes . If the property tax exemption for WECS under current state law is revised or revoked by future Legislatures, Licensee will be responsible for all related assessments and taxes associated with the license and WECS site. Failure to pay such tax obligation shall be considered a non-compliance with this ordinance. C. Reimbursement of Fees and Costs. Licensee shall reimburse the Town for its actual reasonable fees and costs incurred in the application, negotiation, administration and enforcement of this ordinance, including, without limitation, the Town's attorney fees, engineering and consultant fees, Town Board meeting and hearing fees, and the costs of public notices relative to the review and consideration of each application filed by an applicant under this ordinance. The preceding fees are payable within 30 days of invoice. Unpaid invoices shall bear interest at the rate of 1% per month until paid. The Town may recover all reasonable costs of collection, including attorneys fees. XII. WESF NEIGHBOR AGREEMENT A. Neighbor Agreement.
