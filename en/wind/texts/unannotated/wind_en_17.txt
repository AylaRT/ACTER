Test the charge controller. ARI Renewable Energy Co has designed a charge controller with LED display. The three indicating lights separately represent solar, wind and battery. When solar panel is generating charging voltage, solar indicating light will light up; when wind turbine is generating charging voltage, the wind indicating light will light up; and when the battery is charging, the battery indicating light will light up. Turn the switch of the charge controller to "ON". The LED display will turn on if every step of the installation is done correctly. Congratulations! You have now completed the installation process. 6 . C onfiguration 6. 1 Basic C ircuit of ARI Hybrid Solar Wind Generator System 6. 2 S ystem C onfiguration of ARI Hybrid Solar W ind Generator 6.2.1 Battery Bank For ARI-450 wind turbine, two 90-100AH/12V batteries are recommended; and for ARI-600 wind turbine, two 120-150AH/12V batteries are recommended. The cathode of the battery shall be well grounded. Improper diameter of system cable can substantially cause electric power loss. For the minimum requirement of diameters of the cable, please refer to the Table 1 above.

When power is first generated by solar wind turbine, it is stored in the storage of batteries as DC power. It is normally necessary to change it to AC power supply by an inverter. We recommend 110V 50HZ (or 60HZ) inverter. 6.2.3 Charge Controller Before the tower is erected, it is necessary to connect the wind turbine to the charge controller and press the "STOP" button on the controller to shut down the wind turbine. After erection of the tower, please do not start up the wind turbine until the controller and the battery have been reliably connected. The charge charger has the solar-wind supplementary function. The solar energy panel and the wind turbine can simultaneously charge the battery bank! After storage battery charge saturated, the wind turbine automatically moves to bypass load, the red indicating light will turn on; when CPU senses the bypass load operation, CPU automatically stops generating power through short-circuit. 7 . Choosing Site for the Wind Turbine The installation place is very important to the power generating capacity and safe operation of the wind turbine. In order to ensure its normal operation, please refer to the following: The wind turbine will have a greater generating power and capacity with higher wind speed (wind energy is in cubic proportion to wind speed. For instance, the wind energy at a wind speed of 5m/s is nearly double the wind energy at a speed of 4m/s). The wind turbine will be severely damaged and its operational life can be affected if it is installed in a site where there is unstable air flow or severe turbulence. Furthermore, turbulences can substantially reduce power generating capacity. Therefore a site with severe turbulences should not be chosen for installation of the wind turbine. The tower shall be as high as possible. The recommended installing height shall be at least 8m above ground. NOTE: higher the tower is better the working capacity of the turbine. Trees and various constructions can hinder the air flows. The following data are provided for your reference: The tower shall be at least 6m higher than the highest obstacle and 150m away. The tower shall be at least twice higher than the obstacle if they have to be located closely together. 8 . Tower Towers are made with different materials. They come with all shapes, sizes and costs in the market. The most common wind turbine towers are guyed and freestanding towers. NOTE: Radio towers should not be used for wind turbine. Please evaluate your site to determine the appropriate tower height and available acres to install a tower; consider the multiply wind turbines you will install and the cost of the tower. Choose one that fits your budget and the availability of space in your property. 9 . Troubleshooting Problem Possible Cause Solution Blades do not spin or move slowly The blades are not locked tightly to the hub. The blades are reversed and installed upside down. The height of the tower is less than 8m，and surrounding trees and buildings have blocked the flow of wind. Short-circuit of the wiring from the alternator has caused electromagnetic brake, which leads the blades to slow down. Follow these steps: 1）Tight the screws and make sure the blades assembly are on tight to the hub. 2）Make sure the blades are installed correctly without reverse the side of the blades. 3）Increase the heights of the tower; make sure the top of the tower is above the surrounding trees and buildings. 4）Contact our company for possible short circuits of wiring. Turbine is not charging or the battery voltage is too low. Solar panel, wind turbine or battery bank incorrectly connect to the charge controller. Before erecting tower, you connected the alternator to the charge controller but did not turn the switch on the charge controller to "STOP" position to prevent the wind turbine working, which caused an accident short-circuit of the battery bank. You might accidently scratched the cable wires during installation, that has caused short-circuit s or shuts. Bad battery or improper size of batteries is used. One bad battery can high voltage and cause the turbine from charging. 1）Check the connections from the charge controller to the battery bank, solar panel and wind turbine, make sure all the wirings are corrected connected according to this manual; positive to positive and negative to negative. 2）If short-circuit has caused the turbine from charging, please contact us. 3）Ask a certified electrical technician to examine the problem. 4）Make sure you have followed the recommendation of this manual to choose proper batteries for your wind turbine. And the cathode of the battery is well grounded. 10 . Maintenance ARI wind turbine is highly reliable and does not need regular maintenance. However, the overall system of wind turbine - tower - power transmission cables must be inspected and maintained at due time to ensure the system's normal operation. Check if the tower cables are loosened and fasten in a timely manner. Please carry out this inspection multiple times in the initial three months after tower erection. It is also necessary to check it after high winds. Check if various connecting points of the power transmission lines are well-connected and corroded or not. Regularly check and maintain the storage battery as per the maintenance requirements of storage battery. It is recommended to lay down the tower to avoid unforeseeable accidents in case of any approaching extremely rough weather conditions (such as typhoon). 11 .

PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL THE BLADES UNTIL THE TURBINE IS MOUNTED ON THE TOWER. Undersized wire or bad connection can cause over-current electrical dangers and overheat in wiring systems, that could cause fire or inherent personal dangers. PLEASE FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTION ON THE WIRE-SIZING CHART IN THIS MANUAL STRICTLY. PLEASE FUSE ALL CONNECTIONS AND CHOOSE THE CORRECT SIZE OF FUSE OR CIRCUIT BREAKER ACCORDING TO THE GUIDELINES OF THIS MANUAL. It is very important to disconnect all turbine wiring from batteries, turn the controller switch off before installation. Please carefully follow the step by step installation procedures. Connecting the wires to the battery prior to the installation of the turbine can cause the rotor to spin-up during installation and result in personal injury. PLEASE DO NOT ATTACH THE WIRES TO THE BATTERIES THROUGHOUT THE INSTALLATION PROCESS. During tower setup, under no circumstance should any human being stand near the construction site. It is important for you to consult with a local specialized tower installation technician. And you will need someone available to help during the installation process. The turbine installation should take place on the ground level prior mounting the turbine to the tower. PLEASE DO NOT ALLOW ANY UNASSOCIATED PERSON OR CROWD STAND NEAR THE CONSTRUCTION SITE DURING THE INSTALLATION PROCESS. 1. 2 Operation Safety Fasten all tower welding, bolts, nuts and tighten all connections before operation. Before regular maintenance or battery replacement, please shut down the turbine by setting the controller switch to "STOP" position. Please do not disconnect the battery wires when the controller is set to "ON" position. The moving rotor blades can be broken if a solid object comes in contact with them. After setting the controller switch to "STOP" position, you should wait until the blades stop from rotating before any maintenance or inspection of the blades. ARI wind turbine is designed to shut down automatically when a strong wind blows through the site. However, before extreme weather approaches your area, such as but not limited to hurricane, tornado, and extreme winds (110 MPH+; 60 m/s), you should lower down the tower to protect any potential accidence. Before lowering down the tower, you must set the controller switch to "STOP" position, disconnect the wires led to battery, and make sure the blades stop from rotating. 2 .

F eatures 3. 1 Alternator ARI wind alternator is made with high quality, high strength permanent magnetic materials. It is lightweight and compact with high power generating capacity. ARI wind alternator experts have used the unique electromagnetic design technology that has very small starting resistance, thus effectively guarantees the startup of ARI wind turbine even with gentle breezes. The alternator is designed to provide efficient DC power generation with electronic control system. The power capacity and startup performance have made this alternator one of the best alternators in the world. 3. 2 Turbine ARI turbine main body is made with high quality die cast aluminum alloy from a precision casting process and stainless steel components, and thus is lightweight but extremely strong with a very high reliability. Because of the precision casting process, ARI wind turbine not only finishes in perfect shape, but also the aluminum casting functions as a cooling system to the turbine, for it transfers heat into wind passing through the turbine. ARI hybrid solar wind turbine is easy to install and simple to operation. Its unique design will help to create a beautiful skyline while providing clean energy for you in sunny or windy weathers. 3 . 3 Rotor Blades ARI wind turbine blades are made of high strength and high precision cast engineering plastics. The materials are also used in airplane construction industry. The advantage of the materials is its stability and quiet operation. The profile of the wind turbine blades is meticulously designed by aerodynamic experts to have a very low startup and incision points and very high wind energy utilizing ratio. Because of the aerodynamic effects of the blades, propeller racing can be avoided under all circumstances. 3.4 Charge Controller The surface of ARI solar wind charge controller is made from a precision casting process with high quality and die cast oxidize-processed aluminum alloy plate. On the external of the controller, it comes with a digital monitor that can visually display the process of charging and discharging of the battery. A solar charging LED and a wind charging LED are separately displayed on the monitor. When solar power is charging the battery banks, the solar LED will light up and when the wind power is charging the battery banks, the wind charging LED will light up. The controller is designed with the feature of over-speed protection to give ARI solar wind turbine the maximum safety and reliability. The charge controller has a circuit breaker installed to avoid accidental short circuit of the battery. The charge controller is also designed with a voltage regulator that monitors and regulates the battery voltage. When the battery voltage rises above the set point, the CPU automatically shuts off the turbine and the rotor blades then stops rotating. As a result, the wind turbine stops generating power. When the CPU senses a voltage drop, the wind turbine will resume rotating and begin normal charging of the battery. 4.

Please choose a tower, wires, inverter, and battery banks according to the recommendation of this manual. Have the tower on site and get ready all the necessary wires, inverter, and battery banks on site for the installation of the ARI Hybrid Solar Wind Power Generator System. If you choose to install solar panels at the same time as you install the wind turbine, please choose a solar panel according to the instruction and recommendation of this manual. The ratio of solar and wind power need to be 1:3. Choose a calm weather and have someone available to help. If it is necessary, find a local eligible solar wind installer or a certified wind energy electric technician to help the installation process. 5.2 Step-By-Step Instructions Unpack the packing box; check the packing list to make sure every part is included in the packing box. Choose a tower that is at least 8M high for the wind turbine. The type, size and shape of the tower should be chosen according to the condition of the site and availability of space for the wind turbine. Choose appropriate size of cable (3-wires inside a cable) according to the table 1 below (A.W.G standard). Run the cable from the tower base through the tower pole to the top of the tower; from the tower base, gently stretch out the cable to the charge controller (Note: Make sure not to connect the cable to the charge controller until a later stage). NOTE: The table 1 shows the distance from the wind turbine to the charger controller. Model 450 600 Voltage 12V 24V 24V 48V 50M 5# 11# 8# 14# 100M 4# 10# 7# 13# ≥ 3# 7# 6# 12# Strip the insulation back from each set of the three wires out of the tower base; twists the ends of the three wires together. The twisted three wires will function as a brake to ensure the rotor be positioned on the "stop" during the installation. Connect the top of the yaw shaft to the main body shaft, using the stochastic M8*15 stainless steel screws to lock the yaw shaft (torque the screw to 4.1~6.8w.m. Do not over-torque). Then pass the cable wire out of the alternator main body through the pole of the yaw shaft. NOTE: Make sure the yaw shaft does not cut or scratch the cable. Strip the insulation back from each set of the cable out of the top of the tower; connect it to the cable stretched out from the yaw shaft; insulate the connections using either heat shrink tubing or a quality electrical tape. Find a safe place to install the charge controller. Connect the cable from the charge controller to the battery bank. NOTE : The wire size that connects the charge controller to the battery bank needs to follow the recommendation on the section 6.2.1. (Refer to the table on page 21). Improper wiring size can cause the cable over-heat. Make sure the ends of all wires are connected correctly, positive end with positive and negative end with negative separately. Otherwise, it can cause the generator system work improperly, or burn out some parts of the system; If all connections between the charge controller and the battery bank are correct, the digital LED will turn on and two digital numbers for voltage and Amps shall display. Place the yaw shaft connector to the top of the tower pole, lock the yaw shaft firmly. Mount the hub onto the rotor shaft, align the screw holes, place the nut at the end of each screw and tight the screw. Make sure the hub is firmly attached to the rotor shaft. To test if the hub is correctly mounted to the rotor shaft, loose the end of the previously twisted three-wire cable, connect it to the charge controller. Manually move the hub, if the charge controller turns on the LED and the LED displays battery voltage as 1~3V, then you have correctly connected the hub and all the wiring. NOTE: At this point, please turn the switch of the charge controller to the "STOP" position. NOTE: IT IS IMPORTANT TO TURN THE SWITCH OF THE CHARGE CONTROLLER TO THE "STOP" POISITION BEFORE YOU PROCEED TO THE NEXT STEP! Connect solar panel to the charge controller. Before making the connection, please use a dark cloth to cover the solar panel. Please refer to the following table for the choice of your solar panel. 风力发电机 ARI300 ARI450 ARI600 太阳能光伏板 100W 150W 200W 蓄电池 2*90Ah 2*105Ah 2*120Ah WARNING: If you don't cover the solar panel with a dark cloth, under strong sunlight the solar panel can generate high enough voltage to cause injuries of the installers. Please make sure to attach the positive wire from the solar panel to the positive connecting point on the charge controller and negative wire to the negative connecting point (Refer to the diagram below). NOTE: Incorrect connection can cause the wires and parts burn out. Attach the rotor blades to the hub, use M8*30 screws and M8 flat washers to secure the attachment, firmly tighten the screws. Place the nose cone to the center of the rotor blades, close it with nose cone cover and secure it with M6*35 screws and Ф 6 flat washers. Erect the tower. Firmly secure the tower on all stationary positions. NOTE: In the process of erecting the tower, please keep the switch of the charge controller to "STOP" position.

The Optimal Stand-Alone Power System Many remote towns or sparsely populated areas are not serviced by the main power grid. Power has to be generated locally using engine generators powered by conventional fuels, such as diesel. However the transport and storage of diesel fuel can be expensive and the supply is not always reliable. Therefore, diesel generators are best used on a short-term basis or for emergency purpose. Solar and wind energies are good alternatives to provide more consistent year-round energy production. Solar and wind energies are also the most available renewable energy resources on earth, and many remote areas have plenty supply of both. The Sun is the source of all energy on earth. Wind is a form of solar energy and is caused by the uneven heating of the earth's surface by the Sun. For example, the poles receive less energy from the sun than the equator does, and the dry land heats up and cools down more quickly than the seas do. In much of the earth, wind speeds are low in the summer when the sun shines brightest and longest. The wind is strong in the winter when less sunlight is available. Wind speeds are also low during the day when sunlight is strong, but increase after dark when the earth surface is cooler. Because the peak for wind flow and sunlight occur at different times of the day and year, wind energy and solar energy can complement each other. A hybrid solar-wind power system can balance out the ever fluctuating solar and wind resources, and is more likely to produce power when you need it. The Best Combination of Technology Solar power systems use solar panels to convert light energy into electrical energy. Solar regulators, which are also known as solar charge controllers, regulate the solar panel's charging current before it is stored in banks of specially designed batteries. Power inverters are then used to convert direct current (DC) electricity produced by the solar panel cell to alternating current (AC). The advantages of solar system are their reliability and low operating costs. But they are relatively expensive to manufacture. Wind power is the conversion of wind energy into electricity using wind turbines, which turn in the moving air and power an electric generator that supplies an electric current. Similar to solar power systems, charge controllers are used to regulate the charging current and before it is stored in battery banks, and inverters then are used to convert DC to AC. The advantages of wind power systems are their low production and operating costs, but the disadvantage is their low reliability. Solar and wind power systems both suffer from variation in the weather, resulting in inconsistent power supply. Batteries are needed for non-charging periods in order to stabilize supply. However, daily electricity output could fluctuate greatly due to variations in weather. The fluctuation could lead batteries under-charged for a long period of time, causing the battery life to shorten. Since solar power and wind power can complement each other as energy source, a hybrid solar-wind power system will optimize the use of these two natural energy resources for off-grid power supply. Manufacturing costs of hybrid systems can be reduced because the same battery banks and inverters can be used for both the solar and the wind components. However, one obstacle still remains for wide spread use of hybrid wind-solar power systems: the reliability of small wind generator. At ARI, we consider the reliability criteria for wind generator as follows: The speed of wind varies from moment to moment so it is not reliable to rate electricity output based on the wind speed of a particular moment. The average wind speed varies little from year to year for a given area. This allows us to calculate annual electricity generation with reasonable accuracy. Based on the formula, E=0.2D2V3, energy varies with the third power of the wind speed. During the year, wind speed varies between 3m/s and 8m/s. Electricity output should be measured based on the low end of the wind speed instead of the peak speed. Wind generators often have to work in extreme weather conditions such as sand storm, rain storm, turbulent wind climate, and in high salt alkaloid environment. To ensure reliability, the turbine must undergo rigorous test, potentially increasing costs. Systems which are less costly are usually under-tested, and therefore, less reliable. Advanced Over-Speed Protection System As the technology of small wind generator has advanced in past decades, so has the industry. However, the reliability of small wind generator continues to plague this industry. Due to cost considerations, manufacturers tend to use mechanical controllers, which are based on simple principles of aerodynamics, for wind power control, in lieu of the more technologically advanced and more expensive hydraulic pressure controller. While it could pass wind tunnel tests, mechanical controller, which has movable parts, does not work well in the field due to the complexity and rapidity of change in wind speed and wind direction. Often in extreme weather conditions, the movable mechanical parts invariably wear out, resulting in the break-down of the system. Since the fewer the movable parts, the less the chances for a breakdown, high quality wind generators today typically have only three movable parts: Main body of wind turbine Rotor blades Over-speed protection system The first two movable parts are indispensable because they make up the core of a wind turbine. They also do not wear out as easily as the controller. In order to increase reliability, we must turn our attention to the over-speed protection system. All wind turbines are designed with some kind of over-speed protection system. In case of strong wind it is necessary to waste part of the excess energy of the wind in order to avoid damaging the wind turbine. There are two different ways of designing an over-speed protection system on modern wind turbines. Pitch controlled wind turbine that turns blades out of the wind when the wind output becomes too high, and turns them back into the wind when the wind drops. Stall controlled wind turbines that have rotor blades bolted onto the hub at a fixed angle. When the wind speed becomes too high, it creates turbulence on the side of the rotor blade which is not facing the wind. This stall prevents the lifting force of the rotor blade from acting on the rotor. However, both approaches have technical problems. Wind flow is a complex phenomenon. Not only is turbulence a constant occurrence, but also the change of wind speed and direction is instantaneous and frequent. No mechanical apparatus can react swiftly enough to the instant change in wind flow. As a result, the heavy wear and tear often causes the breakdown of the wind turbine. ARI Renewable Energy Co. has developed a brand new electromagnetic brake for ARI hybrid solar-wind generator. The new technology incorporates an entirely new magnetoelectricity regulator that functions as a brake. This brand-new regulating protection idea has discarded the mechanical regulation structure and has fundamentally solved reliable operational problem associated with the hybrid solar-wind generator. This brand-new regulating control idea has following advantages: It has discarded the mechanical regulating structure and the wind turbine therefore only retains two movement parts. As a result, it greatly enhances the structural stability and reliability of the ARI wind turbine. The design of the main body of the wind turbine now has more artistic and diverse choices when the mechanical regulating structure is limited. The advanced over-speed protection system also gives different levels of charge control according to the wind speed scope, which greatly increases the reliability of the ARI hybrid solar-wind power system. I . Safety Precautions ARI Solar-Wind generator is designed under strict safety regulations. However, any electrical and/or mechanical equipment, during installation or operation, can cause potential inherent dangers without safety precautions. Please read thoroughly the following ARI Solar-Wind power generator Safety Precautions before installation of your solar-wind generator. 1.1 I nstallation S afety Rotating blades can move fast enough that the tip of a blade is almost invisible and can cause serious injury when a person comes near the moving rotor blades.
