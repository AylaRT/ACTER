3.5.4 Bats Characterization The DEIS will describe: Data provided by the NYSDEC on bat fatalities from wind turbine collisions at US wind farms; Results of preliminary assessments of bat prevalence in the Project Area; Studies of numbers and species of migrating and resident bats in the Project Area. Specific study plans and procedures will be included as an appendix for the following: Radar Study. Results of the spring and fall radar studies performed as part of the avian assessment will be analyzed to identify the number of radar targets likely to be bats. This will provide information to assess bat migration rates through the Project Area; Ceilometer Observations. During the spring and fall conduct of the radar studies, the technician performing the radar studies will use a ceilometer to visually identify birds or bats in the immediate vicinity of the radar station. This will provide specific information on bat activity in the location of the radar station; Acoustic Monitoring for Resident Bats. In the summer, a period when no bat migrations are expected to occur, handheld acoustic detectors will be used to sample for possible bat echolocation calls at various locations in the Project Area judged to have the ecological conditions suitable for bat activity. Results will be analyzed to provide information on the numbers and species composition of bats resident in the Project Area; Acoustic Monitoring for Migrating Bats. During spring and fall seasons, periods expected to have peak bat migration activity, acoustic detectors will be installed at ground level and at elevations above ground level to continuously detect and record possible bat echolocation calls. Results will be analyzed to provide information on the number and species composition of bats migrating through the Project Area; Impact Assessment The DEIS will assess impacts including, but not limited to: Potential impact of project operation on bat migration activities, considering observed species; numbers; flight patterns (including altitude); climatic conditions; regional geography; data from other studies (including mortality rates due to collisions at similar installations); turbine geometry, operating characteristics, and maximum tip height; Available habitat for endangered and threatened species of bats; Any temporary displacement or permanent loss of migrating and locally breeding species anticipated during construction and operation due to habitat loss, fragmentation, or degradation. Mitigation The DEIS will discuss potential mitigation measures that may include: Modification to turbine locations, quantities, and/or heights Co-locate electric lines along service roads where practicable to minimize impacts to woodlands; Minimize impacts to active agricultural and woodlands by locating service roads along existing farm roads and logging trails as much as possible; Enhancement of habitat by installation of bat boxes or other measures; and NYSDEC requested post-construction mortality monitoring to assess whether further mitigation is indicated 3.6 Visual Resources 3.6.1 Aesthetics Characterization The DEIS will characterize the existing conditions in accordance with the NYSDEC Policy Guide, "Assessing and Mitigating Visual Impacts" (DEP-00-2), including: An inventory of statewide resources, including properties listed or eligible to be listed in the National or State Register of Historic Places; here's an example Any other places in a category of aesthetic resources of statewide significance listed in the NYSDEC Policy Guide; A list of potentially sensitive receptors in the Project Viewshed based on the Comprehensive Plan Update 2001, sections 2A, 2H and 2I and discussions with the Town Board, with brief descriptions and a map showing locations of these receptors. These will include: Residences Churches Parks or recreation facilities Schools Hamlets Main highway corridors Beaver Meadow Audubon night sky study site A description of obstruction lighting required by the Federal Aviation Administration; Plans, elevations, and dimensions for the substation and associated equipment, as well as lighting needs and proposed landscaping; A description of how distance affects the apparent size and degree of contrast between an object and its surrounding. This will be divided into three categories - Foreground (0 to ½ mile), Middleground (1/2 mile to 3 miles) and Background (3-5miles to Horizon). Impact Assessment The DEIS will assess impacts by means including, but not limited to: An advanced 3-dimensional visualization model will be prepared using Arcview GIS software to prepare a "Zone of Visual Influence" map. This Viewshed map will be used to illustrate the areas in the Project Viewshed from which wind turbines could be visible. This map will consider the effects of topography, turbine height (blade at its highest point), existing vegetation, and turbine location, but it will conservatively address the effects of viewer angle, structures, and weather. Evaluation of visual impacts within a five-mile radius is consistent with the NYSDEC's Policy "Assessing and Mitigating Visual Impacts" (DEP-00-2), dated July 31, 2000. However, the DEC states that a larger radius may be appropriate for large-scale projects. For purposes of the DEIS, the Viewshed will initially be considered to be the cumulative area defined by the sum of individual viewsheds of five-mile radii centered on each turbine. If the results of the visual simulations show the impacts to be significant at the cumulative five-mile limit, then the radius of the Viewshed will be expanded for this analysis. Visual simulations from up to twenty-four (24) viewpoints selected to cover the range of typical views, viewpoints expected to have the most observers, and viewpoints considered to be historically or culturally sensitive. At a minimum, viewpoints shall include: One simulation for each of the proposed 12 wind turbine clusters , made from a vantage point generally between ¼ mile to 1-½ miles from the nearest wind turbine in the cluster. These "cluster simulations" shall show typical views of each cluster and shall include at least three turbines from the cluster. Possible locations for the cluster simulations are listed below. The applicant shall provide at least one image from the locations with asterisks in the list below, but may substitute non-asterisked locations if the field photographer finds that other more typical vantage points exist. Cluster A. As seen from the vicinity of the intersection of Maxon and Centerline Roads Cluster B. As seen from the vicinity of Thomas Road, East of Maxon Road Cluster C. As seen from the vicinity of the French Road in the Town of Bennington. Cluster D. As seen from the vicinity of the intersection of Schwab and Humphrey Road. Cluster E. As seen from the vicinity of the intersection of Perry Road and Route 77. Cluster F. As seen from the vicinity of the intersection of Route 77 and Centerline Road, i.e., the Town Hall). Cluster G. As seen from the vicinity of the intersection of Route 20A and Route 77. Cluster H. As seen from the vicinity of the intersection of Bartz Road and Armbrust Road. Cluster I. As seen from the vicinity of the intersection of Bartz Road and Centerline Road. Cluster J. As seen from the vicinity of the intersection of Route 20A and Route 77. Cluster K. As seen from the vicinity of Route 20A, west of Burrough Road. Cluster L. As seen from the vicinity of the intersection of Bloecher Road and Dutch Hollow Road. At least two simulations showing the project as it would be seen from locations in the Town of Bennington. An unspecified number of simulations to address the requirements set forth in the NYS DEC visual policy and to comply with the Town of Sheldon Comprehensive Plan Update 2001, Section 2-I, which states: " The viewsheds identified include, among others, farms, woodlots and other areas of land visible from various poins along dutch Hollow road, Route 77, Maxon Road, Humphrey Road, Route 98, Route 20A, Centerline road and Schwab Road and view corridors into and out of the valleys created by the numerous watercourses of the Town" . This will include views from various sensitive receptors, landscape character areas, including representative views along watercourse valleys, and distances (i.e. foreground, middleground and background). These simulations shall include, at a minimum: A simulation taken from the property of the Byrnecliff Resort or the vicinity of where Humphrey Road runs through the Byrnecliff Resort; A simulation including Saint Cecelia's Church and the wind turbines proposed to be located north of Centerline Road; A simulation taken from the vicinity of the hamlet of Varysburg; A long distance simulation, taken from a location on Route 20A west of the project area and 3-1/2 to 5 miles from the nearest wind turbine, and A long distance simulation, taken from a location on Route 77 north of the project area and 3-1/2 to 5 miles from the nearest wind turbine. The visual simulations shall be prepared by taking photographs with a digital camera with a lens setting equivalent to 50mm. All photos and simulations will be taken and prepared with vegetation in a "leaves-off" condition. Position data (e.g. GPS data) shall be collected at the vantage point for each simulation so that wind turbines are accurately place simulated in the photos. To ensure that the resulting simulations achieve a higher degree of accuracy, Sheldon Energy will model the terrain of the Project Viewshed; A discussion accompanied with representative visual simulations of HSWF wind turbines altered to depict typical viewpoints at night, with FAA-required lighting, including any impacts on night sky study activities at Beaver Meadow Audubon Center; and Line-of-sight (cross section) renderings will be prepared, to show the extent of screening at a minimum of four sensitive locations in order to illustrate the effects of topographic relief and distance on viewsheds. Mitigation The DEIS will assess potential mitigation measures that may include: Uniform design of wind turbines and towers. A neutral, low-reflectivity finish to minimize contrast all buildings associated with the HSWF. However, paint must be an approved color (off-white) required by FAA regulations; Landscaping/fencing to partially screen HSWF buildings and help transition into the surroundings; Mandated FAA lighting at the lowest intensity required for pilot safety; Placing the majority of the electricity collection system underground; Utilizing existing farm or logging roads as service roads where possible; Design of tower heights within a cluster to be as similar as possible; Minimizing fencing, lighting, and access roads to minimize visual impact; Modification of turbine number and locations; Reduced turbine height; and Setbacks from roads and ridge tops. 3.6.2 Wind Turbine Shadow Flicker Characterization The DEIS will describe: Results of a shadow analysis to identify areas that could experience significant shadow flicker and the maximum number of hours per year and minutes per day that such shadow flicker could occur in those areas; and Identification of sensitive receptors.

Any reports prepared as the result of cultural resource investigations for the Project will be included as an appendix to the DEIS. Impacts The DEIS will describe possible impacts, including but not limited to: Construction activities that could potentially impact archaeological resources in areas identified as archeologically sensitive; and Indirect visual impacts on existing structures that are either listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or eligible for listing on the NRHP. Mitigation The DEIS will discuss potential mitigation measures that may include: In the event a previously unknown archeological resource is discovered during construction, all work in the area will cease until representatives from the NYS OPRHP and a cultural resources company can be consulted about the appropriate action to take; The wind turbines and towers will be uniform in design and all buildings associated with the HSWF will have a neutral, low-reflectivity finish to minimize contrast. However, paint must be an approved color (off-white) required by FAA regulations; Landscaping/fencing will be used to partially screen HSWF buildings and help transition into the surroundings; Mandated FAA lighting will be the lowest intensity required for pilot safety and as consistent with requirements for avian impact; The majority of the electricity collection system will be placed underground; and Service Roads will utilize existing farm or logging roads where possible. Noise Characterization The DEIS will discuss: Mechanisms by which noise will be generated during construction (short-term) and operation (long-term), as well as the factors that can increase or decrease perceived noise levels. The most likely sources of sounds from the proposed HSWF are sounds produced during construction of the wind farm from heavy-duty vehicles and equipment; sounds produced by the wind turbines during their operation; and sounds produced during routine maintenance and repair of turbines; Regulatory guidance. Note that Local Law 1-2003 requires that sound levels be at or below 50 dB at the boundary of all non-participating properties. However, the NYSDEC Program Policy "Assessing and Mitigating Noise Impacts" (DEP-00-1) states that In non-industrial settings the SPL should probably not exceed ambient noise by more than 6 dB(A) at the receptor DEP-00-1 also states that: Appropriate receptor locations may be either at the property line of the parcel on which the facility is located or at the location of use or inhabitance on adjacent property ...  The most conservative approach utilizes the property line. The property line should be the point of reference when adjacent land use is proximal to the property line. Reference points at other locations on adjacent properties can be chosen after determining that existing property usage between the property line and the reference point would not be impaired by noise, i.e., property uses are relatively remote from the property line. Accordingly, the DEIS will characterize noise impacts in accordance with the more conservative of the Town of Sheldon Town Law 2003, the Town of Sheldon Comprehensive Plan Update 2001, and/or DEP-00-01; and Ambient noise conditions will be measured, and a baseline established for calculating noise due to the proposed HSWF, according to the following procedure: An experienced noise expert will tour the Project Area, identify the local land uses and noise sensitive receptor locations within one mile of the planned turbine locations, observe the existing sound sources and acoustic environments in the community, and select potential locations for the ambient sound monitoring program. An ambient sound survey will be performed to characterize the existing sound environment in the community areas in the vicinity of the site. The ambient sound survey will include: Continuous measurements of the overall A-weighted sound levels made for up to seven days (weather permitting) at representative community locations near each of two project meteorological towers with automatic monitors. These measurements will provide data on the variations in average ambient sound levels in the community as a function of wind speed; Collection of ambient noise levels (A-weighted and octave band data) at the two continuous monitor locations, including the vicinities of each cluster and at other representative community locations during daytime and nighttime periods. These measurements will be made manually and will be accompanied by observations of the sources of the sounds collected; Collection of ambient low-frequency sound levels (C- weighted sound levels) in the vicinity of the various clusters; All sound measurements will be made with instruments that meet the Type 1 provisions in ANSI S1.4 or IEC 651 and the provisions in ANSI S1.11 or IEC 225.In addition, the DEIS will characterize sources of noise during construction, including: Identify the numbers, types, models, size and rated noise levels of construction equipment required during each phase of construction and their duration of operation; Expected noise levels due to any blasting; Impacts The DEIS assess impacts, using methods including but not limited to: Noise levels at nearest residences or adjacent property linesassociated with the expected, combined mix of construction equipment for each phase of construction; Noise levels at nearest residences or adjacent property lines associated with construction traffic on access roads; Noise levels associated with blasting; An experienced noise consultant will build a computer model using Cadna/A software to estimate the sound to be produced by the proposed project equipment under various wind conditions at locations within one mile of the proposed project. The widely-used Cadna/A program employs ray-tracing technology that accounts for various factors, including geometric spreading, atmospheric absorption, wind conditions, ground absorption, and terrain features; Sound power levels used to model the wind turbines will be based on vendor data that is supported by field testing of operating wind turbines; The DEIS will include a report summarizing the pertinent results of the ambient sound survey and sound modeling tasks. The report will document the ambient measurements, present the estimated sound levels for the wind farm operation in tabular and graphical format, provide comparisons for a range of wind speeds, and as indicated, identify potential noise mitigation methods for the project; The DEIS will identify and discuss the potential impacts resulting from low-frequency noise generators, if any, from each of the project components; Map(s) of the Project area showing contour lines of expected wind turbine (single and combined) sound levels due to operation, as well as increases above ambient levels, based on results of computer models for the proposed Project layout. Sound contour maps shall include locations of wind turbines, residences, and property boundaries; and Evaluation of expected noise levels due to construction and due to maintenance and repair of turbines after construction. Potential impacts from noise issues will be discussed in relation to the set backs required as part of Local Law 1-2003. Mitigation The DEIS will discuss potential mitigation measures that may include: Working with contractors to minimize the construction noise generated. Best management practices will be implemented such as turning off engines when not in use, maintaining equipment in good working order and using adequate engine covers and mufflers in order to minimize noise, scheduling simultaneous operation of heavy equipment to limit the total duration of noise exposure (noise levels are logarithmically rather than arithmetically additive); Restricting hours of operation to reasonable daytime hours in accordance with applicable Town Law; Mandatory property line setbacks for non-participating permanent residences to mitigate operational noise. A specific setback distance will be recommended. Other setbacks to non-participating, non-permanent residences and property lines may be established; and Other mitigation measures as outlined in DEP-00-01. 3.11 Roads Characterization The DEIS will include the following information: Road conditions and dimensions required for construction and project component transportation vehicles, e.g., pavement width, weight limits, and turning radii, etc.; Identification of the primary travel routes expected to be used by construction and Project component transportation vehicles, including a description of the physical and operational characteristics of these roads, e.g., width, gradient, existing traffic, number of lanes, surface materials and routing restrictions.

Mitigation The DEIS will discuss potential mitigation that may include: Best management practices would be implemented during HSWF construction to minimize spills and soil tracking; If improvements are required, road, culvert and intersection upgrades will be the responsibility of Sheldon Energy; Repairs to local roads due to movement of heavy equipment during construction will be the responsibility of Sheldon Energy; Scheduling of work to reduce duration and impact of any traffic delays; Delivery of large wind turbine components (blades, tower sections, and nacelles), construction equipment, and bulk materials (concrete, gravel, re-bar) will be planned and managed to minimize traffic impacts road damage. Permanent adverse impacts to existing roads will be avoided by making upgrades to roads prior to HSWF construction and by making all necessary repairs to roads following construction. It is expected that, following construction, all upgrades and resurfacing of existing roads will result in a net benefit to the project area's transportation system; and Balance visual and agricultural impacts due to road construction along ridge tops 3.12 Microwave Beam Interference Characterization The DEIS will identify the microwave beams that cross the HSWF. The DEIS will include a map and other information necessary to show existing microwave paths and demonstrate that these microwave paths will not be obstructed by wind turbines or other Project components. Impacts Wind turbines have the potential to interfere with microwave signals by obstructing line-of-sight microwave transmitters. Based on microwave path analysis, five wind turbine sites are located along four microwave paths and have the potential for signal interference. Mitigation The DEIS will discuss potential mitigation measures that may include: Using rotor blades constructed of fiberglass/carbon material and asynchronous (brushless) generators to reduce the potential for electromagnetic interference; Siting turbines to avoid point-to-point microwave transmission paths; If future complaints relative to degraded television reception due to project operation arise, mitigation actions could include adjusting existing receiving antennae's, install community step up signal antenna and related equipment, providing cable (if available), satellite reception, or other measures to the affected households who were utilizing a household antenna for their broadcast television reception needs as of the date of the FEIS. 3.13 Cell Phone Interference Public concern has been raised regarding the potential for wind turbines to interfere with local cell phone coverage. The DEIS will describe experience at existing wind farms, published reports, and available expert testimony to assess the potential of the Project to affect local cell phone usage. 3.14 Air Quality During construction, air-borne dust could be generated during road and foundation construction. Also, air emissions will be generated by construction-related traffic. The DEIS will discuss dust suppression techniques to be used during project construction, and it will compare the air emissions from Project construction to the potential offsets that could result from generating electricity from wind instead of from fossil fuels. 3.9 Socioeconomics Characterization The DEIS will describe the existing economic conditions and resources, including: Pioneer and Attica Central School Districts; Police, fire, and emergency service providers serving the Project Area; Services of Employment (NYS Dept. of Labor data); Town of Sheldon tax base information; State and local tax or other financial incentives for development of wind farms; Proposed PILOT agreement between the Town of Sheldon and the applicant; Typical PILOT agreements in other New York communities with wind farm developments; Commercial businesses in the Project Area; Local demographics; and Identification, by interviews with representative local businesses, the ourism base in the Town of Sheldon and Wyoming County, and identification, by discussion with business and local government leaders, of wind farm impacts on tourism in other New York towns.

A.1 Project Description Sheldon Energy LLC ("Sheldon Energy"), a subsidiary of Invenergy Wind LLC, proposes to construct the High Sheldon Wind Farm (HSWF), a wind-powered electric generating facility in the Town of Sheldon, Wyoming County, New York. The proposed HSWF will consist of installation of up to 86 wind turbines for the purpose of generating 129 Megawatts (MW) or less of electricity in the Town of Sheldon. A.2 Proposed Action Under the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQR) Part 617, the proposed action will include approval for the installation and operation of up to 86 wind turbines and the associated electric lines (below grade and limited overhead), a substation and related facilities including interconnection facilities for the connection to the New York State Electric and Gas Corporation's (NYSEG) existing 230 kV transmission line, access roads, parking areas, operations and maintenance facilities, and two permanent meteorological towers. The potential siting of these facilities will be addressed in a "worst-case" scenario approach in order to ensure a thorough evaluation of the potential impacts in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) A.3 Purpose of Scoping and the SEQR Process The Sheldon Town Board ("Town Board") has received twelve (12) applications for Special Use Permits from Sheldon Energy for development of the HSWF and subsequently solicited for Lead Agency status. The Town Board identified the project as a Type 1 Action for the purposes of SEQR under 6 NYCRR Part 617 - State Environmental Quality Review (SEQR). The Town Board reviewed the potential environmental impacts of the HSWF against the criteria listed in Part 617.7 and determined that the HSWF may have a significant effect on the environment and that a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) must be prepared. Figure 1 shows a Project layout based on the initial zoning applications submitted to the Town of Sheldon (the "Zoning Application Layout"). Pursuant to Town of Sheldon Local Law 1-2003, twelve (12) separate applications have been submitted. The applications are being reviewed together to avoid segmentation. The Zoning Application Layout is the most likely Project layout based on conditions known at the time of this Scoping Document. Changes to the Zoning Application Layout may be required to accommodate SEQRA mitigation measures and other conditions. According to Part 617.8, Scoping is the process by which the Lead Agency identifies potentially significant adverse impacts that should be considered in a draft EIS. As part of the EIS process and in accordance with SEQR section 617.8, a Draft Scoping document was prepared by Sheldon Energy and submitted to the Town Board on February 2, 2005. A public scoping session was held on March 14, 2006 at 7:00 pm at the Strykersville Fire Hall, 594 Minkel Rd, Strykersville, NY. The scoping session was conducted to solicit public input for the preparation of this document and to ensure that the DEIS will include relevant public concerns and will be appropriate in its scope and content. Written comments on the draft Scope were accepted until the end of the business day on Friday, 17 March 2006. Stantec Consulting Services, Inc. has been engaged by the Sheldon Town Board to assist in the preparation of a Final Scoping document to guide the development of the DEIS.
