Diuretic use in heart failure and outcomes.
Diuretics are frequently administered to relieve congestive symptoms in patients with heart failure (HF). Despite their widespread use, prospective data on the potential of diuretics to modulate HF-related morbidity and mortality are scarce. Diuretic efficacy may be limited by adverse neurohormonal activation and by "congestion-like" symptoms that may occur in the absence of fluid overload. Herein, we review the current knowledge on diuretic use and outcomes in HF.
