Heart failure: a disease complex with challenging therapeutics.
Heart failure (HF) is the most common cause of cardiovascular hospitalization, especially among the elderly. It has a higher mortality and morbidity than several cancers and consumes a significant portion of the health-care budget. HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is commoner among women who may have underlying hypertension. Significant progress has been achieved in the development of lifesaving drugs for HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). However, treatment of HFpEF still poses significant challenges.
