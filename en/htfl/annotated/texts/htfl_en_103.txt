Experience of a vasopressin receptor antagonist, tolvaptan, under the unique indication in Japanese heart failure patients.
Tolvaptan is a vasopressin type 2 receptor antagonist. Currently, tolvaptan is indicated for the treatment of severe hyponatremia in most countries, including the United States, but in Japan the indication is broader; it can be used in congestive heart failure patients in addition to standard or optimal diuretic therapy, regardless of their serum sodium levels or systolic function. Our review of this newly introduced drug is based on our experience in Japan.
