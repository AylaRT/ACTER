Do anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs have a role in treating heart failure in  the absence of atrial fibrillation?
Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) are at risk for stroke, and progress in anticoagulation has led to new options for these patients. Patients in sinus rhythm may benefit from antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants, but much work remains to establish efficacy and safety. Additional progress is needed, including better tools for risk stratification and clarity regarding the need for antiplatelet agents in combination with anticoagulants for those with other vascular diseases.
