A CLCNKA polymorphism (rs10927887; p.Arg83Gly) previously linked to heart failure is associated with the estimated glomerular filtration rate in the RENASTUR cohort.
A total of 569 individuals aged 55-85 and Caucasian were genotyped for SNP rs10927887 in the Ka renal chloride channel gene (CLCNKA). The following variables were significantly associated with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of (eGFR) <60 ml/min./1.73 m(2): age, type 2 diabetes, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and the CLCNKA GG genotype (p=0.03; OR=1.65, 95% CI=1.04-2.62). This novel finding could partly explain the reported greater risk of heart failure linked to the CLCNKA SNP, but requires confirmation on other populations.
