Remote ischemic conditioning for patients with heart failure?
Management of patients with heart failure (HF), stemming from ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathies, continues to be problematic, despite the inroads made in the pharmacological armamentarium, by implantable cardioverter defibrillators, cardiac resynchronization therapy, and the eventual resort to cardiac transplantation, and left and/or right ventricular assist devices. Both patients with low left ventricular ejection fraction and patients with HF with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction are admitted to the hospital frequently and serially and keep physicians busy, in the acute and outpatient settings, for their management, also prompting them to search for better ways to deal with this worldwide epidemic and its impact on medical resources and financial costs.
