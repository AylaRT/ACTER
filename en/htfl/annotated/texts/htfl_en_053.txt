Right atrial myxoma complicated by pulmonary embolism and revealed by right heart failure.
Myxomas are the most common type of cardiac benign tumors and most of them are located in the left atrium, followed by the right atrium. Myxomas in the right atrium may rarely embolize to the pulmonary arterial vasculature. Here, we present a case report of a patient with right atrial myxoma and massive embolism to the pulmonary arteries treated surgically with right atrial mass removal and pulmonary embolectomy. The right atrium mass presented with prolapse through the tricuspid valve causing a stenotic physiology. The left pulmonary artery was completed occluded and the right pulmonary artery was partially obstructed. Surgical tactics included a brief hypothermic circulatory arrest. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was asymptomatic after 6 months of follow-up.
