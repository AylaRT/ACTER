Usefulness and consequences of cardiac resynchronization therapy in dialysis-dependent patients with heart failure.
Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is often deferred in dialysis-dependent patients with heart failure (HF) because of a perceived lack of benefit and potentially higher risks, although the outcomes associated with CRT in dialysis have not been reported. We therefore studied our center's experience with CRT in dialysis-dependent patients. We constructed a descriptive assessment of these patients (n = 15) and performed a case-control analysis matching for age, gender, bundle branch morphology, diabetes mellitus, cardiomyopathy origin, and β-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker use. Baseline and 6-month echocardiograms were assessed for evidence of reverse remodeling. No periprocedural or long-term complications were observed among dialysis patients. Heterogenous improvement in ejection fraction (+3.1 ± 9.2%) was noted and 2 patients derived absolute improvements of 8% and 22%, respectively. Dialysis patients demonstrated the following 3-year event rates: HF hospitalization, 31%; all-cause hospitalization, 100%; mortality, 73%; and HF hospitalization or death, 82%. In the case-control analysis, controls demonstrated superior reverse remodeling (+9.2 ± 9.5% increase in ejection fraction), decreased mortality (73% vs 44%, p = 0.038), and all-cause hospitalizations (76% vs 100%, p = 0.047), with no difference in HF hospitalizations (p = 0.39), compared with dialysis patients. In conclusion, at our center, the dialysis-dependent patients with HF who underwent CRT implantation did so safely and no serious complications were observed. Certain dialysis patients demonstrated compelling improvement after device implantation. Compared with matched controls, dialysis patients were at increased risk for adverse events and worsened echocardiographic outcomes.
