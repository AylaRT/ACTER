MicroRNAs in heart failure: new targets in disease management.
Heart failure is the leading cause of mortality in Western society and represents the fastest growing subclass of cardiovascular diseases. An increasing body of evidence indicates an important role for microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathogenesis and progression of heart failure. miRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that regulate expression of target genes by sequence-specific binding to the 3' untranslated region of messenger RNA, which results in degradation or translational repression. To date, many miRNAs (and their targets) that play a role in diverse aspects of cardiac remodeling and heart failure development have been identified. Here, we give an overview of these miRNAs and their role in cardiac pathogenesis. In addition, we provide brief insight into the potential of miRNAs as novel therapeutic targets for heart failure.
