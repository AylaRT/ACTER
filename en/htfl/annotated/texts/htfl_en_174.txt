Future of advanced heart failure and mechanical support devices: A Cardiology-Cardiovascular Surgery Consensus Report
Heart failure is a progressive disease. A considerable number of patients eventually reach an advanced or terminal phase, in spite of developments in diagnostic procedure, alternative treatments that can slow progression, management, and follow-up. In addition to palliative care of patients in the terminal phase, accurate recognition of advanced disease is vital in the determination of therapeutic options. Overall management of patients with heart failure requires the collaboration of professionals from multiple disciplines. Still, patients with advanced heart failure should be managed by a "heart team," as indicated by guidelines; communication and collaboration among cardiologists, cardiovascular surgeons, and other medical staff responsible for patient care is necessary. While our country has physicians experienced in the management of patients with advanced heart failure, these professionals are not distributed evenly across the country, and equitable access to therapeutic options is not provided. Hence, progress has yet to be made regarding appropriate referrals and patient circulation. The aims of the present consensus report are to strengthen the connection between certified, experienced centers and those that care for patients irrespective of disease phase and healthcare staff, as well as to raise awareness and provide information regarding conditions in Turkey.
