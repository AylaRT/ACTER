Study PARADIGM-HF - a paradigm shift in the treatment of chronic heart failure
Chronic heart failure is a crucial problem of current cardiology. Despite that, no major development has occurred in the therapy in recent years. In this regard, first results of studies with ARNI inhibitors (angiotensin-receptor neprilysin inhibitors) may be considered hopeful. Dual inhibition of AT1 receptors and neprilysin blocks renin-angiotensin-aldosteron (RAS) axis and concurrently supports natural vasodilatory and diuretic effect of natriuretic peptides. Large-scale prospective randomized multicenter trial PARADIGM-HF with more than 8000 individuals with stabilized chronic heart failure with systolic dysfunction (LV EF 40%, later 35%), mostly in functional class NYHA II-III with elevated BNP/NT-pro BNP has shown 20% decrease in primary endpoint (cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure) in a group treated by ARNI (LCZ696; sacubiltril - valsartan). Beneficial effect of ARNI was consistent also for total and cardiovascular mortality, for hospitalization for heart failure and in other pre-specified subgroup analyses, including quality of life. The treatment was safe, typical adverse event was hypotension, however without a need to interrupt the treatment. Dual RAS and neprilysin inhibition might thus after long time become a change in stable chronic heart failure with systolic dysfunction treatment "paradigm". Czech Republic significantly contributed to this study and all study sites should be congratulated and thanked for their high-quality work provided.
