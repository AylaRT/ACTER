Assessing the link between air pollution and heart failure.
Ambient air pollution is a well-recognised risk factor for cardiovascular health, and it has been shown to be an important trigger of acute myocardial infarction. In The Lancet, Anoop Shah and colleagues provide a new systematic review of the effects of air pollution on heart failure, a common disorder associated with high morbidity and mortality, especially in elderly people. Physicians and professionals in public health should be aware that the air pollution experienced in most urban and industrial areas can aggravate cardiovascular health and lead to hospitalisation and death.
