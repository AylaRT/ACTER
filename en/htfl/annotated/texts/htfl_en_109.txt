Atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure: a cost analysis of rhythm-control vs. rate-control strategies.
BACKGROUND:
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common in patients with heart failure. Rhythm- and rate-control strategies are associated with similar efficacy outcomes. We compared the economic impact of the 2 treatment strategies in patients with AF and heart failure from the province of Québec, Canada.
METHODS:
In a substudy of the Atrial Fibrillation and Congestive Heart Failure trial, health care expenditures of patients from Québec randomized to rhythm and rate-control treatment strategies were compared from a single-payer perspective using a cost-minimization approach. In-trial resource utilization and unit costs were estimated from Québec Health Insurance Board databases supplemented by disease-specific costs from the Ontario Case Costing Initiative.
RESULTS:
In all, 304 patients were included, aged 68 ± 9 years; 86% male; ejection fraction, 26% ± 6%. Baseline characteristics were similar in rhythm-control (n = 149) and rate-control (n = 155) groups. Arrhythmia-related costs accounted for 45% of total expenditures. Rate-control patients had fewer cardiac procedures (146 vs. 238, P < 0.001), driven by fewer cardioversions, and lower costs related to antiarrhythmic drugs (CAD $48 per patient [95% confidence interval {CI}, $21-$96] vs. $1319 per patient [95% CI, $1124-$1522]). However, these differences were offset by higher expenditures due to hospitalizations for noncardiovascular diagnoses, implantable cardiac arrhythmia devices, and noncardiovascular drugs in the rate-control group. The total cost per patient was not significantly different between rhythm-control ($72,764 [95% CI, $61,575-$85,145]) and rate-control ($78,767 [95% CI, $67,101-$92,139]) strategies.
CONCLUSION:
In the study population, the therapeutic strategy used to manage AF in patients with severe heart failure appears to have little influence on the overall financial burden, which remains substantial.
