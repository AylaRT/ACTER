Psychometric testing of the Self-Care of Heart Failure Index Version 6.2.
The Self-Care of Heart Failure Index Version 6.2 (SCHFI v.6.2) is widely used, but its psychometric profile is still questioned. In a sample of 659 heart failure patients from Italy, we performed confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to test the original construct of the SCHFI v.6.2 scales (Self-Care Maintenance, Self-Care Management, and Self-Care Confidence), with limited success. We then used exploratory factor analysis to determine the presence of separate scale dimensions, followed by CFA in a separate sub-sample. Construct validity of individual scales showed excellent fit indices: CFI = .92, RMSEA = .05 for the Self-Care Maintenance Scale; CFI = .95, RMSEA = .07 for the Self-Care Management Scale; CFI = .99, RMSEA = .02 for the Self-Care Confidence scale. Contrasting groups validity, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability were supported as well. This evidence provides a new understanding of the structure of the SCHFI v.6.2 and supports its use in clinical practice and research.
