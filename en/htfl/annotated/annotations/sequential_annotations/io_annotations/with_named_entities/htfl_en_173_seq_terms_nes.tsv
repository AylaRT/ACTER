Mammalian	I

(	O
Mena	I

is	O
a	O
key	O
regulator	O
of	O
cytoskeletal	I
actin	I
dynamics	I

which	O
has	O
been	O
implicated	O
in	O
heart	I

(	O

We	O
have	O
previously	O
demonstrated	O
that	O
cardiac	I
Mena	I

produced	O
cardiac	I
dysfunction	I
with	O
conduction	O

and	O
hypertrophy	I

Moreover	O

elevated	O
Mena	I

correlates	I

HF	I

human	O
and	O
animal	O
models	O

yet	O
the	O
precise	O
role	O
of	O
Mena	I

cardiac	I

unclear	O

In	O
these	O

we	O
evaluated	O

cardiac	I

We	O
found	O
that	O
the	O
hearts	I

mice	O
were	O
functionally	O

morphologically	O

were	O

either	O
immediately	O

immediately	O

we	O

normalizing	O
Mena	I

eliminated	O
cardiac	I

These	O

that	O
hearts	I
