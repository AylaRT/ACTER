BACKGROUND	O

The	O

1	I
(	O
S1PR1	I
)	O
and	O
β1-adrenergic	I
receptor	I
(	O
β1AR	I
)	O
are	O
G-protein-coupled	I
receptors	I
expressed	O
in	O
the	O
heart	I
.	O

These	O
2	O
receptors	I
have	O
opposing	O
actions	O
on	O
adenylyl	I

of	O

Importantly	O
,	O
both	O
of	O
these	O

can	O
be	O
regulated	O
by	O
the	O
actions	O

G-protein-coupled	I

,	O
which	O
triggers	O

Although	O

suggest	O
that	O
simultaneous	O
activation	O
of	O
β1ARs	I
and	O
S1PR1s	I

a	O
