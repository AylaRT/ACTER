BACKGROUND	O

Early	O
physician	I
follow-up	I
after	O
discharge	I
is	O
associated	O
with	O
lower	O
rates	O
of	O
death	I
and	O
readmission	I
among	O
patients	I
with	O
heart	I

We	O

whether	O
physician	I
continuity	O
further	O
influences	O
outcomes	I

METHODS	O

We	O
used	O
data	O
from	O

administrative	O

for	O
all	O

20	O

were	O
discharged	I

from	O
hospital	I
between	O
January	O
1999	O
and	O
June	O
2009	O
with	O
a	O
first-time	O
diagnosis	I
of	O
heart	I

We	O
used	O
Cox	I

covariates	I
to	O
analyze	O
the	O
