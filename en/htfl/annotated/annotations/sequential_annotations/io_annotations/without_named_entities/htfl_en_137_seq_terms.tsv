Understanding	O
of	O
chronic	I
heart	I
failure	I
(	O
HF	I
)	O
has	O
progressed	O
from	O
the	O
concept	O
of	O
a	O
purely	O
hemodynamic	I
disorder	O
to	O
that	O
of	O
a	O
syndrome	I
that	O
results	O
from	O
dysfunction	I
in	O
interconnected	O
molecular	I
pathways	I
.	O

As	O
a	O
result	O
,	O
the	O
focus	O
of	O
research	O
investigations	O

clinical	I
care	O
has	O
shifted	O
to	O
measurement	O
and	O
modification	O

maladaptive	O
molecular	O
processes	O

Accumulating	O
evidence	O

that	O
molecular	O
biomarkers	I
provide	O
a	O
window	O

the	O
pathophysiology	I

the	O

biomarkers	I

the	O

remains	O

This	O

result	O

this	O

we	O
summarize	O
the	O
potential	O
therapeutic	I
implications	O
