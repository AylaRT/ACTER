HISTORY	O
AND	O
CLINICAL	I
FINDINGS	O
:	O

We	O
present	O
a	O
41-year-old	O
man	O
with	O
cardiac	I
arrest	I
in	O
need	O
of	O
cardiopulmonary	I
resuscitation	I
(	O
CPR	I
)	O
with	O
the	O
diagnosis	I
of	O
a	O
posterior	I

infarction	I
,	O
who	O
was	O
hospitalized	I
in	O
our	O
cardiac	I
centre	O

INVESTIGATIONS	O
:	O

The	O
cardiac	I
catheterization	I
showed	O
a	O
thrombotic	I
obstruction	I
of	O
the	O
right	I
coronary	I
artery	I
.	O

After	O
percutaneous	I
coronary	I
revascularization	I
a	O
hemodynamically	I
stable	I
situation	O
could	O
be	O
achieved	O
and	O
the	O
patient	I
was	O
admitted	O
to	O
the	O
intensive	I
care	I
unit	I
(	O
ICU	I
)	O
.	O

TREATMENT	O
AND	O
CLINICAL	I
COURSE	O
:	O

The	O
patient	I
became	O
again	O
hemodynamically	I
unstable	O
and	O
a	O
CPR	I
was	O
required	O
.	O

Based	O
on	O
the	O
acute	I
right	I
heart	I
failure	I
with	O
therapy	I
refractory	I
cardiogenic	I
shock	I
we	O
decided	O
within	O
our	O

for	O
an	O

)	O
applied	O
during	O
CPR	I
in	O
the	O
ICU	I

The	O
extracorporeal	I
support	I
was	O
needed	O
for	O
three	O
days	O
.	O

Seven	O
days	O
after	O
the	O
emergency	O
cardiac	I
catheterization	I
the	O
patient	I
was	O
extubated	I
and	O
transferred	O

CONCLUSION	O
:	O

Extracorporeal	I
life	I
support	I
is	O
feasible	O

effective	O
for	O
bridging	O
therapy	I
in	O
