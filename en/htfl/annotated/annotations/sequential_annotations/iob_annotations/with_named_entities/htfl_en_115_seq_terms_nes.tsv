We	O
present	O
a	O

man	O
with	O
cardiac	B
arrest	I
in	O
need	O
of	O
cardiopulmonary	B

INVESTIGATIONS	O
:	O

The	O
cardiac	B
catheterization	I
showed	O
a	O
thrombotic	B
obstruction	I
of	O
the	O
right	B

After	O
percutaneous	B
coronary	B
revascularization	I
a	O
hemodynamically	B

situation	O
could	O
be	O
achieved	O
and	O
the	O

TREATMENT	O
AND	O
CLINICAL	B
COURSE	O
:	O

The	O
patient	B
became	O
again	O
hemodynamically	B

Based	O
on	O
the	O
