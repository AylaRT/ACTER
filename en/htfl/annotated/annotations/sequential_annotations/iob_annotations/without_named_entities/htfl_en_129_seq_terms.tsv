BACKGROUND	O

The	O

1	I
(	O
S1PR1	B
)	O
and	O
β1-adrenergic	B
receptor	I
(	O

)	O
are	O
G-protein-coupled	B
receptors	I
expressed	O
in	O
the	O
heart	B

These	O
2	O
receptors	B
have	O
opposing	O
actions	O

Importantly	O
,	O
both	O

these	O

be	O

Although	O

that	O
simultaneous	O
activation	O
of	O
β1ARs	B

S1PR1s	B
