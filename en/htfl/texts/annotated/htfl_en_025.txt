Comparison of predictors of heart failure-related hospitalization or death in patients with versus without preserved left ventricular ejection fraction.
Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is recognized as a major cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. An ability to identify patients with HFpEF who are at increased risk for adverse outcomes can facilitate their more careful management. We studied the patients having heart failure (HF) using data from the Heart Failure Adherence and Retention Trial (HART). HART enrolled 902 patients in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III who had been recently hospitalized for HF to study the impact of self-management counseling on the primary outcome of death or HF hospitalization. In HART, 208 patients had HFpEF and 692 had HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and were followed for a median of 1,080 days. Two final multivariate models were developed. In patients having HFpEF, predictors of primary outcome were male gender (odds ratio [OR] 3.45, p = 0.004), NYHA class III (OR 3.05, p = 0.008), distance covered on a 6-minute walk test (6-MWT) of <620 feet (OR 2.81, p = 0.013), and <80% adherence to prescribed medications (OR 2.61, p = 0.018). In patients having HFrEF, the predictors were being on diuretics (OR 3.06, p = 0.001), having â‰¥3 co-morbidities (OR 2.11, p = 0.0001), distance covered on a 6-MWT of <620 feet (OR 1.94, p = 0.001), NYHA class III (OR 1.90, p = 0.001), and age >65 years (OR 1.63, p = 0.01). In conclusion, indicators of functional status (6-MWT and NYHA class) were common to both patients with HFpEF and those with HFrEF, whereas gender and adherence to prescribed therapy were unique to patients having HFpEF in predicting death or HF hospitalization.
