Impact of heart magnetic resonance imaging on chelation choices, compliance with  treatment and risk of heart disease in patients with thalassaemia major.
This study aimed to verify the impact of heart magnetic resonance imaging on chelation choices and patient compliance in a single-institution cohort as well as its predictive value for heart failure and arrhythmias. Abnormal cardiac T2* values determined changes in treatment in most subjects. Heart T2* was confirmed to be highly predictive over 1 year for heart failure and arrhythmias. The choice of chelation regimens known to remove heart iron efficiently was not sufficient by itself to influence the risk. Compliance with treatment had a more remarkable role.
