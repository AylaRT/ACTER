Learning from recent trials and shaping the future of acute heart failure trials.
The last decade of acute heart failure (HF) research is characterized by disappointments in large phase 2 and 3 pharmacologic studies of therapeutics including calcium-sensitizing agents and antagonists of endothelin, vasopressin, and adenosine. As a result, pharmacologic management for acute HF has changed little in recent years, and adverse event rates remain higher than in chronic HF. Despite neutral results in many acute HF trials, recent studies including RELAX-AHF, ASTRONAUT, and PRONTO have highlighted the role of appropriate timing of patient enrollment, targeting the "right" patients, and selecting appropriate end points and sites. We describe lessons learned from recent trials in acute HF and outline strategies to improve the potential for success in future trials.
