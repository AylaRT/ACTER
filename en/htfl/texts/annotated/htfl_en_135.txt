First-in-class angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor in heart failure.
Neprilysin inhibitors augment the natriuretic peptide system by preventing the breakdown of atrial natriuretic peptide and B-type natriuretic peptide. LCZ696, an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor composed of a neprilysin inhibitor prodrug and the angiotensin receptor antagonist valsartan, has proven effective in hypertension, has shown promise in a pilot trial of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and is being tested in a large outcomes trial of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. A preserved ejection fraction outcomes trial is beginning.
