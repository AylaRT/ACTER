Risk factors and outcomes associated with the development of myocardial ischemic events in patients who receive cardiac resynchronization therapy.
There are limited data regarding risk factors for the development of ischemic events (IEs) among patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (IC) who receive cardiac resynchronization therapy with a defibrillator (CRT-D) and their effect on the efficacy of the device. The present study population comprised 1,045 patients with IC enrolled in the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial-Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy. We used multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression modeling to identify risk factors for the development of IE (comprising hospitalization for acute coronary syndromes and/or coronary interventions during the trial) among study patients. Time-dependent analysis was performed to identify the effect of IE on the risk for subsequent heart failure (HF) or death in CRT-D recipients. Independent predictors for the development of IE among study patients included previous revascularization (coronary artery bypass surgery: hazard ratio [HR] 1.88, p = 0.003; percutaneous coronary intervention: HR 3.21, p <0.001) and increased systolic blood pressure (HR 1.67, p = 0.02), whereas a left bundle branch block pattern on the baseline electrocardiogram was associated with reduced risk for IE (HR 0.62, p = 0.02). Treatment with CRT-D did not have a significant effect on IE risk compared with defibrillator-only therapy (HR 0.87, p = 0.51). Time-dependent analysis showed that the development of IEs among CRT-D recipients was associated with more than twofold (p = 0.01) increased risk for subsequent heart failure or death. In conclusion, our data suggest that treatment with CRT-D does not reduce the risk of IE in patients with IC and that the benefit of CRT-D is attenuated after the development of IEs in this population.
