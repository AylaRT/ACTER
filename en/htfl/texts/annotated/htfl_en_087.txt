Measuring heart failure care by 30-day readmission: Rethinking the quality of outcome measures.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has operationalized hospital quality of care outcomes through publicly reported 30-day risk-standardized mortality and readmission rates and associated penalties for higher-than-expected rates. The objective of the measure is to motivate hospitals to improve the quality of care they provide patients hospitalized for heart failure (HF) and other conditions such as acute myocardial infarction, pneumonia, with expected future expansion to other conditions.
