The reality of heart failure in Latin America.
Heart failure (HF) data in Latin America (LA) were reviewed to guide health service planning in the prevention and treatment of HF. The HF epidemiology and the adequacy of relevant health service provision related to HF in LA are not well delineated. A systematic search of the electronic databases and the World Health Organization website was undertaken for HF in LA. LA countries have reduced gross income and lower total expenditure on health per capita. LA is a heterogeneous region with HF risk factors of developed and nondeveloped countries, including lower risk of raised blood glucose levels, obesity, tobacco, and aging, whereas systemic hypertension (SH), rheumatic fever, and Chagas' disease (C'D) are higher in LA. Main etiologies of HF in LA are idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (from 1.3% to 37%), C'D (from 1.3% to 21%), ischemic (from 68% to 17%), SH (from 14% to 76%), valvular (from 3% to 22%), and alcohol related (from 1.1% to 8%). The prognosis of C'D HF is worse than for other etiologies. Chronic HF is the cause of death in 6.3% of cases. Decompensated HF is the main cause of cardiovascular hospitalization. The prevalence of systolic HF varies from 64% to 69%. LA is under the awful paradox of having the HF risk factors and HF epidemiology of developed countries with the added factors of SH, C'D, and rheumatic fever. Overall, in the scenario of lower total expenditure on health per capita and lower gross national income per capita, new strategies are essential for prevention and treatment of HF in LA.
