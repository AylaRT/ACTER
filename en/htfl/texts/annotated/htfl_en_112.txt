Baseline and 6-Week follow-up levels of PAF and activity of its metabolic enzymes in patients with heart failure and healthy volunteers--a pilot study.
This study aimed at evaluating the changes in platelet-activating factor (PAF) and its metabolic enzymes over a 6-week follow-up period in patients with newly diagnosed heart failure ([HF] n = 12) compared with age-, sex-, and BMI-matched apparently healthy volunteers (n = 10). The PAF, its key biosynthetic enzymes (lyso-PAF acetyltransferase [lyso-PAF-AT] and dithiothreitol [DTT]-insensitive CDP choline: 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol cholinephosphotransferase [PAF-CPT]), and its catabolic isoenzymes (PAF-acetylhydrolase [PAF-AH] and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 [Lp-PLA2]) were measured in serum and leukocytes of participants. At baseline, patients with HF had lower median activities of lyso-PAF-AT (P < .001) and PAF-CPT (P = .07) in parallel with PAF levels (P = .05) and higher activities of PAF-AH (P = .02) and Lp-PLA2 (P < .001) than controls. At follow-up, PAF-CPT and PAF levels marginally increased (P = .1), lyso-PAF-AT (P < .001) remained downregulated, while PAF-AH (P = .004) and Lp-PLA2 (P < .001) remained elevated compared with the controls. Newly diagnosed patients with HF under drug treatment have an affected profile of PAF biosynthetic enzymes and especially lyso-PAF-AT.
