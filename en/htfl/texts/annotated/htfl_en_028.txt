A novel heart failure mice model of hypertensive heart disease by angiotensin II  infusion, nephrectomy, and salt loading.
Although the mouse heart failure (HF) model of hypertensive heart disease (HHD) is useful to investigate the pathophysiology and new therapeutic targets for HHD, the model using simple experimental procedures and stable phenotypes has not been established. This study aimed to develop a novel mouse HF model of HHD by combining salt loading and uninephrectomy with ANG II infusion. Eight-week-old C57BL/6 male mice were treated with ANG II infusion (AT), ANG II infusion and uninephrectomy (AN), ANG II infusion and salt loading (AS), or ANG II infusion, uninephrectomy, and salt loading (ANS). Systolic blood pressure was significantly elevated and left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy was found in AT, AN, AS, and ANS mice, and there were no significant differences in those parameters between the four groups. At 6 wk after the procedures, only ANS mice showed significant decreases in LV fractional shortening and increases in lung weight with a high incidence. This phenotype was reproducible, and there were few perioperative or early deaths in the experimental procedures. Severe LV fibrosis was found in ANS mice. Oxidative stress was enhanced and small GTPase Rac1 activity was upregulated in the hearts of ANS mice. After the addition of salt loading and uninephrectomy to the ANG II infusion mouse model, cardiac function was significantly impaired, and mice developed HF. This might be a novel and useful mouse HF model to study the transition from compensated LV hypertrophy to HF in HHD.
