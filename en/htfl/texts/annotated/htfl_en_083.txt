The described report deals with the case of a patient with diagnosis of ischemic-hypertensive cardiomyiopathy based on the history of angina and inducible myocardial ischemia with normal coronary arteries. However, after cardiac magnetic resonance, the typical amyloidotic pattern is found and the final diagnosis of multiple myeloma is made at osteomedullary biopsy.
