Gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with ventricular assist devices: what every cardiac nurse should know.
Patients with end-stage heart failure are increasingly being treated with implantation of a long-term ventricular assist device. As the use of these devices has grown, health care providers have been faced with managing clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding in this population. Gastrointestinal bleeding is not uncommon and is reported to occur in 13% to 44% of patients treated with ventricular assist devices. Interestingly, because patients with ventricular assist devices are housed on units accustomed to managing the device, cardiac nurses are often asked about the management of gastrointestinal bleeding. This article describes the possible causes of, the array of diagnostic procedures for, and treatments for this complication. It is critical to develop an understanding of this topic so cardiac nurses can partner with other subspecialty groups to manage this population.
