this	O
classical	O

exercise	I
that	O

In	O
the	O
18th	O
century	O
,	O
the	O
French	O
riding	I
master	O
François	I
Robichon	I
de	I
La	I
Guérinière	I
was	O
looking	O
for	O
an	O
exercise	I
that	O
created	O
more	O
shoulder	I
freedom	I
in	O
the	O
horse	I
,	O
enabling	O
him	O
to	O
move	I
laterally	I
in	O
an	O
easier	O
and	O
more	O
beautiful	O
way	O
.	O

As	O
a	O
result	O
,	O
he	O
invented	O
the	O
shoulder-in	I
,	O
which	O
has	O
become	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
fundamental	O
exercises	I
in	O
the	O
training	I
of	O
a	O
dressage	I
horse	I
.	O

It	O
is	O
not	O
only	O
a	O
requirement	O
in	O
dressage	I
tests	I
but	O
also	O
the	O

The	O
rider	I
who	O
is	O
able	O
to	O
ride	I
his	O
horse	I
in	O
a	O
correct	O

Every	O
horse	I
has	O
some	O
natural	O
crookedness	I
,	O
which	O
the	O
rider	I
must	O
diminish	O
in	O
his	O
training	I
.	O

Horses	I
tend	O
to	O
fall	I
in	I
with	O
their	O
haunches	I
when	O
moving	O
on	O
a	O
straight	O
line	O
because	O
the	O
hindquarters	I
are	O
wider	O
than	O
the	O
shoulders	I
.	O

The	O
systematic	O
training	I
under	I
saddle	I
is	O
to	O
improve	O
this	O
natural	O
left	O
-	O
or	O
right-handedness	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
supple	I
horse	I
on	O
both	O
hands	I
.	O

The	O
horse	I
must	O
be	O
made	O
straight	I
and	O
step	I
with	O
both	O
hind	I
legs	I
in	O
exactly	O
the	O
same	O
direction	O
as	O
the	O
front	I
legs	I
.	O

As	O
a	O
consequence	O
,	O
the	O
legs	I
are	O
being	O
burdened	O
evenly	O
as	O
opposed	O
to	O
evading	O
sideways	I
.	O

Many	O
riders	I
forget	O
that	O
the	O
horse	I
has	O
four	O
legs	I
since	O
,	O
from	O
their	O
position	O
in	O
the	O
saddle	I
,	O
they	O
only	O
see	O
the	O
forehand	I
.	O

Suppleness	I
and	O
elasticity	O
in	O
the	O
haunches	I
,	O
however	O
,	O
are	O
fundamental	O
qualities	O
in	O
a	O
well-trained	I
dressage	I
horse	I
.	O

The	O
forward-sideways	I
moving	O
in	O
the	O
shoulder-in	I
helps	O
the	O
rider	I
improve	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
lateral	I
bend	I
and	O
activate	I
the	O
haunches	I
to	O
develop	O
more	O
carrying	O
power	O

Now	O
it	O

The	O
Aids	I
for	O
Shoulder-In	I

In	O
shoulder-in	I
,	O
the	O
horse	I
is	O
bent	I
around	O
the	O
rider	I
's	O
inside	I
leg	I
at	O
about	O
a	O
30-degree	O
angle	O
,	O
moving	O
forward	I
on	O
three	O
tracks	I
.	O

The	O
hindquarters	I
remain	O
on	O
the	O
first	I
track	I
,	O
while	O
the	O
rider	I
guides	O
the	O
forehand	I
toward	O
the	O
inside	I
of	O
the	O
arena	I
so	O
that	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
inside	I
hind	I
leg	I
moves	O
in	O
the	O
direction	O
of	O
the	O
outside	I
front	I
leg	I
.	O

The	O
outside	I
hind	I
leg	I
is	O
on	O
the	O
first	I
track	I
,	O
the	O
inside	I
hind	I
leg	I
and	O
outside	I
front	I
leg	I
are	O
on	O
the	O
second	I
track	I
and	O
the	O
inside	I
front	I
leg	I
moves	O
on	O
the	O
third	I
track	I
.	O

Ideally	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
shoulder-in	I
,	O
the	O
rider	I
gives	O
the	O
horse	I
security	O
through	O
his	O
own	O
inner	O
balance	I
.	O

This	O
causes	O
the	O
horse	I
to	O
concentrate	O
more	O
on	O
the	O
rider	I
than	O
on	O
his	O
natural	O
instincts	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
crucial	O
that	O
the	O
rider	I
guides	O
the	O
horse	I
with	O
the	O
outside	I
rein	I
and	O
determines	O
the	O
degree	O
of	O
flexion	I
with	O
the	O
inside	I
rein	I
.	O

At	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
,	O
the	O
rider	I
increases	O
the	O
weight	O
on	O
his	O
inside	I
seat	I
bone	I
,	O
drives	I
the	O
horse	I
forward	I
/	I
sideways	I
with	O
his	O
inside	I
leg	I
at	I
the	I
girth	I
and	O
maintains	O
the	O
haunches	I
with	O
his	O
outside	I
leg	I
behind	I
the	I
girth	I
(	O
this	O
is	O
called	O
a	O
guarding	I
outside	I
leg	I

)	O

When	O
working	O
on	O
the	O
shoulder-in	I
,	O
it	O
is	O
highly	O
important	O
to	O
distinguish	O
between	O
a	O
horse	I
with	O
square	O
conformation	I
and	O
a	O
horse	I
with	O
rectangular	O
conformation	I
(	O
see	O
photos	O
)	O
.	O

The	O
square	O
horse	I
requires	O
more	O
lateral	I
bend	I
in	O
the	O
shoulder-in	I
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
execute	O
it	O
correctly	O
on	O
three	O
tracks	I
.	O

One	O
has	O
achieved	O
the	O
correct	O
amount	O
of	O
bend	I
when	O
the	O
horse	I
can	O
see	O
his	O
inside	I
hind	I
leg	I
with	O
his	O
inside	I
eye	I
.	O

In	O
this	O
ideal	O
case	O
,	O
the	O
horse	I
is	O
bent	I
like	O
a	O
banana	O
.	O

When	O
working	O
with	O
a	O
rectangular	O
horse	I
,	O
one	O
easily	O
ends	O
up	O
on	O
four	O
tracks	I
instead	O
of	O
three	O
if	O
one	O
allows	O
too	O
much	O
lateral	I
bend	I
.	O

The	O
rider	I
should	O
only	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
inner	O
half	O
of	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
face	O
.	O

Generally	O
,	O
riders	I
do	O
better	O
with	O
rectangular	O
horses	I
because	O
we	O
tend	O
to	O
make	O
square	O
horses	I
too	O
short	O
in	O
their	O
necks	I
.	O

The	O
square	O
horse	I
's	O
body	O
is	O
already	O
so	O
compact	O
that	O
he	O
easily	O
gets	O
too	O
short	O
in	O
his	O
neck	I
when	O
sitting	I
more	O
on	O
his	O
haunches	I
,	O
such	O
as	O
when	O
riding	I
shoulder-in	I
.	O

When	O
and	O
How	O
to	O
Begin	O

In	O
dressage	I
tests	I
,	O
the	O
shoulder-in	I
is	O
introduced	O
at	O
Second	I
Level	I
.	O

When	O
schooling	I
,	O
I	O
recommend	O
using	O
it	O
also	O
at	O
First	I
Level	I
because	O
the	O
throughness	I
it	O
creates	O
in	O
the	O
horse	I
also	O
improves	O
his	O
straightness	I
.	O

Shoulder-in	I
improves	O
the	O
articulation	O
of	O
the	O
joints	I
in	O
the	O
haunches	I
,	O
improves	O
the	O
shoulder	I
freedom	I
and	O
makes	O
the	O
horse	I
more	O
supple	I
.	O

Furthermore	O
,	O
it	O
consolidates	O
a	O
horse	I
's	O
balance	I
,	O
and	O
he	O
becomes	O
more	O
obedient	I
.	O

Personally	O
,	O
I	O
teach	O
the	O
shoulder-in	I
to	O
very	O
young	O
horses	I
.	O

It	O
helps	O
them	O
develop	O
better	O
balance	I
earlier	O
on	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
are	O
better	O
gymnasticized	I
.	O

The	O
increased	O
sense	O
of	O
security	O
this	O
gives	O
them	O
also	O
makes	O
them	O
mentally	O
stronger	O
.	O

You	O
ca	O
n't	O
teach	O
an	O
old	O
dog	O
new	O
tricks	O
is	O
a	O
motto	O
I	O
like	O
to	O
apply	O
when	O
it	O
comes	O
to	O
essential	O
exercises	I
,	O
such	O
as	O
the	O
shoulder-in	I
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
recommend	O
that	O
an	O
inexperienced	O
rider	I
not	O
start	O
the	O
shoulder-in	I
before	O
the	O
horse	I
is	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
his	O
fourth	O
year	O
to	O
prevent	O
taking	O
away	O
too	O
much	O
rhythm	I
and	O
impulsion	I
from	O
the	O
horse	I
.	O

If	O
you	O
start	O
too	O
early	O
,	O
the	O
hindquarters	I
tend	O
to	O
be	O
left	O
out	O
behind	O
instead	O
of	O
stepping	I
more	O
under	O
.	O

A	O
shoulder-in	I
is	O
not	O
necessarily	O
a	O
correct	O
shoulder-in	I
.	O

It	O
all	O
depends	O
on	O
the	O
quality	O
of	O
the	O
execution	O

Voltes	I
:	O
These	O
small	O
circles	I
are	O
the	O
foundation	O
for	O
developing	O
the	O
shoulder-in	I
.	O

The	O
horse	I
must	O
have	O
learned	O
to	O
move	O
on	O
bent	I
lines	O
in	O
correct	O
lateral	I
bend	I
and	O
take	O
up	O
more	O
weight	O
with	O
his	O
inner	I
hind	I
leg	I
.	O

He	O
must	O
step	I
into	O
the	O
outside	I
rein	I
and	O
respond	O
to	O
half	I
halts	I
and	O
full	I
halts	I
.	O

The	O
rider	I
must	O
sit	O
in	O
balance	I
,	O
his	O
shoulders	I
parallel	O
to	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
shoulders	I
.	O

If	O
all	O
of	O
this	O
is	O
in	O
place	O
,	O
one	O
can	O
begin	O
with	O
the	O
shoulder-fore	I

Shoulder-fore	I
:	O
I	O
start	O
by	O
setting	O
my	O
horse	I
up	O
for	O
a	O
change	I
through	I
the	I
diagonal	I
after	O
the	O
corner	I
of	O
the	O
short	I
side	I
of	O
the	O
arena	I
.	O

However	O
,	O
instead	O
of	O
allowing	O
my	O
horse	I
to	O
actually	O
change	I
through	I
the	I
diagonal	I
,	O
I	O
continue	O
to	O
ride	I
down	O
the	O
long	I
side	I
with	O
this	O
same	O
amount	O
of	O
bend	I
.	O

This	O
way	O
I	O
achieve	O
a	O
shoulder-fore	I
,	O
a	O
preliminary	O
exercise	I
to	O
the	O
shoulder-in	I
.	O

The	O
goal	O
is	O
to	O
align	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
legs	I
with	O
the	O
hind	I
legs	I
,	O
which	O
gives	O
the	O
horse	I
a	O
slight	O
flexion	I
and	O
bend	I
.	O

While	O
his	O
inner	I
hind	I
leg	I
steps	I
between	O
his	O
front	I
legs	I

his	O
outside	I
hind	I
leg	I
must	O
remain	O
on	O
the	O
track	I
of	O
the	O
equilateral	I
front	I
leg	I

Because	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
hind	I
legs	I
now	O
step	I
closer	O
together	O
,	O
this	O
preliminary	O

Shoulder-in	I
:	O
If	O
the	O
rider	I
now	O
slowly	O
increases	O
flexion	I
and	O
bend	I
,	O
the	O
shoulder-fore	I
turns	O
into	O
a	O
shoulder-in	I
.	O

It	O
's	O
crucial	O
that	O
the	O
rider	I
first	O
guides	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
head	I
,	O
then	O
his	O
shoulders	I
,	O
then	O
his	O
midsection	O
and	O
,	O
only	O
then	O
,	O
the	O
hindquarters	I
.	O

To	O
really	O
live	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
horse	I
,	O
the	O
rider	I
must	O
mentally	O
divide	O
the	O
execution	O
of	O
the	O
shoulder-in	I
into	O
these	O
four	O
sections	O
.	O

Furthermore	O
,	O
being	O
two-legged	O
creatures	O
,	O
we	O
need	O
to	O
understand	O
the	O
situation	O
of	O
a	O
four-legged	O
creature	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
beginning	O
,	O
choose	O
a	O
slow	O
tempo	I
that	O
gives	O
the	O
horse	I
the	O
chance	O
to	O
find	O
the	O
right	O
balance	I

Here	O
the	O
rider	I
must	O
always	O
pay	O
attention	O
to	O
the	O
evenness	O
of	O
the	O
rhythm	I

Once	O
the	O
shoulder-in	I
has	O
been	O
confirmed	O

start	O
working	O
on	O

Practice	O
the	O
shoulder-in	I
in	O
short	O
intervals	O

changing	O
frequently	O
between	O

the	O
track	I
again	O
with	O
your	O
outside	I

I	O
recommend	O
practicing	O
shoulder-in	I
on	O
the	O

Common	O
Problems	O

While	O
there	O
is	O
only	O
one	O
correct	O
way	O
to	O
execute	O
a	O
shoulder-in	I
,	O
there	O
are	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O
mistakes	O
,	O
which	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
time	O
are	O
caused	O
by	O
the	O
rider	I

who	O
must	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
help	O
the	O
horse	I
with	O
his	O
body	O
,	O
not	O
impede	O
him	O
.	O

As	O
with	O
all	O
exercises	I
,	O
the	O
rider	I
needs	O
to	O
be	O
mentally	O
and	O
physically	O
at	O
least	O
three	O
steps	O
ahead	O
of	O
the	O
horse	I
.	O

Only	O
then	O
can	O
the	O
pair	O
achieve	O
harmony	O
and	O
,	O
through	O
the	O
rider	I
's	O
invisible	O
aids	I
,	O
dressage	I
becomes	O
beautiful	O
to	O
the	O
observer	O
.	O

In	O
order	O
to	O
achieve	O
this	O
goal	O
,	O
the	O
rider	I
must	O
recognize	O
mistakes	O
in	O
advance	O
before	O
they	O
actually	O
happen	O
.	O

The	O
horse	I
escapes	O
over	O
his	O
outside	I
shoulder	I
when	O
the	O
rider	I
fails	O
to	O
guide	O
him	O
with	O
the	O
outside	I
rein	I
.	O

For	O
the	O
majority	O
of	O
riders	I
,	O
the	O
inside	I
rein	I
dominates	O
.	O

This	O
way	O
,	O
the	O
problem	O
starts	O
already	O
on	O
normal	O
bent	I
lines	O
and	O
multiplies	O
as	O
the	O
degree	O
of	O
difficulty	O
in	O
a	O
movement	I
increases	O
.	O

So	O
the	O
inside	I
hand	I
is	O
only	O
responsible	O
for	O
flexing	O
and	O
suppling	I
the	O
poll	I

A	O
good	O
rider	I
is	O
able	O
to	O
yield	I
with	O
the	O
inside	I
hand	I
at	O
any	O
given	O
moment	O
without	O
losing	O
the	O
contact	I

since	O
the	O
rider	I
guides	O
and	O
steers	O
the	O
horse	I
with	O
the	O
outside	I

Many	O
riders	I
collapse	O
their	O

shifting	O
their	O
weight	O
to	O
the	O

this	O
by	O
simply	O
stepping	I

Only	O
the	O
rider	I
who	O
truly	O
weights	O
his	O
inside	I

is	O
able	O
to	O
shift	O
his	O
weight	O
onto	O
the	O

step	I
into	O
it	O

Constantly	O
check	O
your	O

they	O

If	O
the	O
horse	I
still	O
escapes	O
over	O
his	O
outside	I
shoulder	I

ride	I
short	O
intervals	O
of	O
shoulder-in	I

and	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
each	O
shoulder-in	I

straighten	I
the	O
neck	I
and	O
ride	I
towards	O
the	O
inside	I
of	O
the	O
arena	I

The	O
hind	I
legs	I
fall	I
out	I
when	O
the	O
rider	I
steers	O
too	O
much	O
with	O
the	O
hands	I
and	O
fails	O
to	O
guard	O
the	O
exercise	I
with	O
the	O
outside	I
leg	I
.	O

The	O
tension	O
in	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
topline	I
is	O
too	O
high	O
.	O

Because	O
he	O
has	O
four	O
legs	I
,	O
this	O
causes	O
the	O
horse	I
to	O
find	O
a	O
way	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
will	O
fall	I
out	I
with	O
the	O
hind	I
legs	I

When	O
encountering	O
this	O
problem	O
,	O
the	O
rider	I
must	O
re-create	O
relaxation	I
and	O
transfer	O
it	O
into	O
the	O
exercise	I
.	O

Often	O
times	O
,	O
it	O
's	O
sufficient	O
to	O
ride	I
a	O
volte	I
,	O
making	O
sure	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
thrown	O
to	O
the	O
outside	I
like	O
a	O
centrifuge	O
.	O

The	O
inside	I
,	O
forward-sideways-driving	I
leg	I
must	O
remain	O
in	O
a	O
forward	O
position	O
with	O
the	O
toe	I
at	I
the	I
girth	I
.	O

The	O
horse	I
sways	O
if	O
the	O
rider	I
's	O
weight	O
has	O
shifted	O
to	O
the	O
outside	I
.	O

In	O
addition	O
the	O
rider	I
uses	O
too	O
strong	O
rein	I
aids	I
,	O
which	O
he	O
is	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
live	O
up	O
to	O
with	O
his	O
driving	I
leg	I
aids	I
.	O

As	O
a	O
result	O
,	O
the	O
horse	I
loses	O
rhythm	I
and	O
impulsion	I
and	O
tries	O
to	O
evade	O
the	O
rider	I
.	O

To	O
solve	O
the	O
problem	O
,	O
the	O
rider	I
must	O
begin	O
with	O
more	O
calmness	O
and	O
demonstratively	O
sit	O
to	O
the	O
inside	I
.	O

Furthermore	O
,	O
he	O
must	O
be	O
mentally	O
riding	I
shoulder-in	I
before	O
the	O
horse	I
enters	O
it	O
.	O

Having	O
chosen	O
a	O
calm	O
tempo	I
at	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
the	O
shoulder-in	I
,	O
increase	O
the	O
tempo	I
step-by-step	O
.	O

Ride	I
only	O
brief	O
intervals	O
of	O
shoulder-in	I
,	O
interspersing	O
it	O
with	O
voltes	I
and	O
riding	I
straight	O
ahead	O
.	O

One	O
loses	O
impulsion	I
if	O
the	O
angle	O
is	O
too	O
large	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
case	O
,	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
time	O
,	O
the	O
leg	I
pairs	O
already	O
move	O
on	O
four	O
tracks	I
instead	O
of	O
three	O
,	O
and	O
rhythm	I
faults	O
develop	O
.	O

One	O
mistake	O
creates	O
the	O
next	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
horses	I
often	O
also	O
become	O
too	O
short	O
in	O
their	O
necks	I
.	O

To	O
prevent	O
this	O
from	O
happening	O
,	O
the	O
rider	I
must	O
have	O
the	O
horse	I
set	O
up	O
correctly	O
in	O
preparation	O
for	O
the	O
shoulder-in	I
.	O

This	O
is	O
where	O
most	O
mistakes	O
occur	O
.	O

The	O
rider	I
will	O
again	O
have	O
too	O
much	O
pressure	O
in	O
the	O
hands	I
,	O
which	O
he	O
ca	O
n't	O
live	O
up	O
to	O
with	O
his	O
driving	I
leg	I
aids	I
.	O

At	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
,	O
the	O
shoulder-in	I
often	O
is	O
ridden	I
for	O
too	O
long	O
a	O
period	O
of	O
time	O
.	O

Quiet	O
horses	I
,	O
in	O
particular	O
,	O
will	O
quickly	O
lose	O
impulsion	I
.	O

The	O
rider	I
must	O
ride	I
short	O
reprises	O
of	O
shoulder-in	I
only	O
and	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
end	O
the	O
exercise	I
at	O
the	O
best	O
moment	O
.	O

If	O
the	O
rider	I
exhausts	O
each	O
exercise	I
he	O
rides	I
,	O
the	O
horse	I
tends	O
to	O
lose	O
joy	O
and	O
interest	O
in	O
the	O
work	O
.	O

If	O
we	O
riders	I
enjoy	O
and	O
exhaust	O
the	O
beautiful	O
exercises	I
too	O
often	O
,	O
we	O
destroy	O
them	O
.	O

Another	O
mistake	O
of	O
the	O
rider	I
is	O
that	O
he	O
demands	O
perfection	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
try	O
.	O

Instead	O
,	O
approach	O
an	O
exercise	I
slowly	O
,	O
and	O
only	O
demand	O
perfection	O
in	O
the	O
second	O
or	O
third	O
attempt	O
.	O

First	O
,	O
the	O
horse	I
must	O
become	O
supple	I
,	O
just	O
like	O
his	O
rider	I
.	O

The	O
horse	I
and	O
rider	I
must	O
find	O
each	O
other	O
anew	O
at	O
each	O
step	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
why	O
,	O
before	O
a	O
dressage	I
test	I
,	O
one	O
rides	I
an	O
exercise	I
a	O
few	O
times	O
before	O
entering	O
the	O
show	I
ring	I
.	O

Tilting	O
the	O
head	I
is	O
easy	O
to	O
recognize	O
.	O

If	O
the	O
ears	I
are	O
not	O
level	O
,	O
he	O
is	O
tilting	O
.	O

The	O
biggest	O
error	O
lies	O
in	O
missing	O
outside	I
rein	I
contact	I
.	O

If	O
the	O
inside	I
rein	I
dominates	O
,	O
it	O
turns	O
the	O
shoulder-in	I
into	O
some	O
sort	O
of	O
head-in	I
instead	O
of	O
shoulder-in	I
.	O

To	O
correct	O
this	O
mistake	O
,	O
give	O
frequent	O
half	I
halts	I
with	O
your	O
outside	I
rein	I
and	O
relax	I
your	O
inside	I
hand	I
.	O

When	O
working	O
with	O
a	O
rectangular	O
horse	I
,	O
avoid	O
seeing	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
inside	I
eye	I
,	O
keeping	O
him	O
almost	O
straight	I
.	O

A	O
square	O
horse	I
does	O
n't	O
easily	O
tilt	O
his	O
head	I
,	O
so	O
when	O
he	O
tilts	O
his	O
neck	I
,	O
the	O
rider	I
must	O
have	O
made	O
various	O
mistakes	O
.	O

Most	O
often	O
,	O
the	O
horse	I
is	O
not	O
correctly	O
on	O
the	O
driving	I
aids	I
and	O
gets	O
too	O
short	O
in	O
his	O
neck	I
.	O

The	O
rider	I
must	O
support	O
the	O
horse	I
through	O
his	O
own	O
balance	I
so	O
that	O
rhythm	I
and	O
impulsion	I
can	O
develop	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
,	O
he	O
must	O
increase	O
the	O
tempo	I
step-by-step	O
with	O
his	O
inside	I
leg	I
.	O

Most	O
of	O
the	O
time	O
,	O
the	O
riders	I
hands	I
dominate	O
over	O
the	O
driving	I
leg	I
aids	I
.	O

Also	O
,	O
we	O
riders	I
tend	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
impatient	O
and	O
ask	O
for	O
exercises	I
in	O
our	O
training	I
for	O
which	O
the	O
horse	I
is	O
n't	O
supple	I
enough	O

the	O

of	O

in	I

Training	I
the	O
Shoulder-In	I

Most	O
of	O
the	O
time	O

I	O
ride	I
a	O
shoulder-in	I
right	O
away	O
in	O
the	O
warm-up	I
phase	O
at	O
rising	I
trot	I

It	O

me	O
to	O
gymnasticize	I
my	O
horses	I
optimally	O
for	O
the	O
work	O
to	O
come	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
only	O
recommend	O
this	O
if	O
the	O
rider	I
is	O
balanced	I
enough	O
and	O
able	O
to	O
support	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
impede	O

the	O

For	O
this	O
special	O
way	O
of	O
warming	O
a	O
horse	I
up	O
,	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
time	O
I	O
ride	I
on	O
the	O
second	I
track	I
so	O
the	O
horse	I
completely	O
trusts	O
my	O
aids	I
,	O
even	O
when	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
wall	I

I	O
then	O
ride	I
only	O
five	O
to	O
eight	O
steps	I

and	O
then	O
ride	I
a	O

This	O

I	O
ride	I
four	O

five	O
voltes	I
along	O
the	O

Here	O
is	O
where	O
the	O
biggest	O
mistakes	O
occur	O
later	O
on	O
,	O
since	O
the	O
difficult	O
movements	I
always	O
begin	O
after	O
a	O
short	O
stride	I

The	O
voltes	I
should	O
always	O
be	O
five	O
to	O
six	O
meters	O
in	O
diameters—for	O
the	O
square	O

after	O

I	O
prepare	O

during	O
the	O
whole	O
training	I
session	O
almost	O

in	O
a	O

time	O
and	O
guide	O
it	O
into	O
a	O

It	O

horses	I
that	O
are	O
particularly	O
fearful	O
to	O
become	O
more	O
confident	O

with	O
the	O
result	O

Horses	I
with	O

problems	O
at	O

from	O
riding	I
in	O

as	O
it	O

In	O
general	O

one	O

take	O
care	O
to	O
be	O
ahead	O
of	O
the	O

A	O
good	O
