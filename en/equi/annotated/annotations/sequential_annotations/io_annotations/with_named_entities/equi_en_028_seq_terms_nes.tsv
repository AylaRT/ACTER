it	O
's	O

Let	O
's	O
begin	O
with	O
the	O
definition	O
of	O
a	O
turn	I
on	I
the	I
haunches	I
.	O

The	O
horse	I
's	O
forehand	I
moves	O
in	O
even	O
,	O
quiet	O
and	O
regular	O
steps	I
around	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
inner	I
hind	I
leg	I
while	O
maintaining	O
the	O
rhythm	I
of	O
the	O
walk	I
.	O

The	O
horse	I
is	O
bent	I
to	O
the	O
inside	I
and	O
needs	O
to	O
keep	O
an	O
active	I
,	O
clear	O
,	O
four-beat	I
medium	I
walk	I
.	O

It	O
can	O
be	O
performed	O
in	O
90	O
,	O
180	O
and	O
360	O
degrees	O
.	O

The	O
turn	I
on	I
the	I
haunches	I
is	O
preparatory	O
for	O
the	O
walk	I
pirouette	I
.	O

In	O
the	O
half	I
turn	I
on	I
the	I
haunches	I
,	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
horse	I
turns	O
only	O
180	O
degrees	O
,	O
the	O
inside	I
hind	I
leg	I
is	O
allowed	O
to	O
travel	O
up	O
to	O
1	O
meter	O
and	O
the	O
horse	I
is	O
not	O
required	O
to	O
step	I
with	O
his	O
inside	I
hind	I
leg	I
in	O
the	O
same	O
spot	O
each	O
time	O
it	O
leaves	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
but	O
may	O
move	O
slightly	O
forward	I
.	O

The	O
walk	I
pirouette	I
should	O
be	O
ridden	I
more	O
or	O
less	O
on	O
the	O
spot	O
with	O
the	O
inside	I
hind	I
leg	I
stepping	I
up	O
and	O
down	O
as	O
the	O
shoulders	I
are	O
turned	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
walk	I
pirouette	I
the	O
horse	I
is	O
bent	I
to	O
the	O
inside	I
,	O
but	O
the	O
pirouette	I
is	O
performed	O
from	O
a	O
collected	I
walk	I
and	O
only	O
a	O
half	O
meter	O
of	O
travel	O
is	O
allowed	O
.	O

Like	O
the	O
turn	I
on	I
the	I
haunches	I
,	O
the	O
walk	I
pirouette	I
can	O
be	O
performed	O
in	O
90	O
,	O
180	O
and	O
360	O
degrees	O
.	O

To	O
begin	O
,	O
make	O
sure	O
that	O
your	O
horse	I
understands	O
what	O
you	O
are	O
asking	O
him	O
to	O
do	O
and	O
that	O
all	O
your	O
basic	O
aids	I
are	O
in	O
order—left	I
leg	I
means	O
move	O
right	O
,	O
right	I
leg	I
means	O
move	O
left	O
and	O
both	O
legs	I
mean	O
move	O
forward	I
.	O

Sensitivity	O
and	O
balance	I
are	O
key	O
to	O
riding	I
a	O
good	O
turn	I
on	I
the	I
haunches	I
,	O
as	O
the	O
movement	I
should	O
be	O
ridden	I
by	O
changing	O
the	O
balance	I
in	O
your	O
body	O
and	O
not	O
by	O
pushing	O
and	O
pulling	O
.	O

For	O
example	O
,	O
if	O
you	O
push	O
too	O
hard	O
with	O
your	O
outside	I
leg	I
within	O
the	O
turn	I
on	I
the	I
haunches	I
or	O
pirouette	I
,	O
you	O
will	O
push	O
your	O
horse	I
sideways	I
and	O
out	O
of	O
balance	I
.	O

Address	O
your	O
horse	I
's	O
sensitivity	O
level	O
if	O
you	O
feel	O
that	O
is	O
a	O
factor	O
.	O

When	O
riding	I
a	O
turn	I
on	I
the	I
haunches	I
or	O
a	O
walk	I
pirouette	I
,	O
think	O
of	O
cutting	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
pie	O
.	O

Your	O
outside	I
rein	I
and	O
leg	I
work	O
together	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
Move	O
over	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
your	O
inside	I
leg	I
says	O
,	O
Step	I
forward	I
.	O

Think	O
of	O
your	O
inside	I
leg	I
as	O
being	O
a	O
pole	O
in	O
the	O
ground	O
and	O
your	O
horse	I
has	O
to	O
wrap	O
himself	O
around	O
the	O
pole	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
lean	O
on	O
it	O
.	O

Note	O
that	O
any	O
half	I
halt	I
given	O
needs	O
to	O
be	O
proportionate	O
to	O
the	O
amount	O
of	O
impulsion	I
and	O
leg	I
you	O
have	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
walk	I
it	O
is	O
usually	O
no	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
closing	O
of	O
the	O
fist	I
and	O
the	O
calf	I
to	O
avoid	O
disrupting	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
balance	I
.	O

Walk	I
pirouettes	I
and	O
turns	I
on	I
the	I
haunches	I
require	O
a	O
tremendous	O
amount	O
of	O
balance	I
from	O
the	O
rider	I
.	O

It	O
is	O
your	O
job	O
to	O
guide	O
your	O
horse	I
and	O
initiate	O
the	O
movement	I
by	O
using	O
the	O
smallest	O
of	O
aids	I
in	O
order	O
to	O
keep	O
and	O
maintain	O
the	O
balance	I
.	O

It	O
is	O
critical	O
that	O
you	O
address	O
any	O
issues	O
in	O
your	O
position	O
.	O

If	O
you	O
collapse	O
in	O
a	O
hip	I
or	O
sit	O
crookedly	O
to	O
either	O
side	O
,	O
it	O
will	O
prevent	O
you	O
from	O
turning	O
a	O
good	O
pirouette	I
.	O

Imagine	O
a	O
ballerina	O
pirouetting	I
.	O

It	O
would	O
take	O
very	O
little	O
for	O
her	O
to	O
fall	O
out	O
of	O
balance	I
.	O

The	O
same	O
is	O
true	O
for	O
your	O
horse	I
.	O

Sit	O
facing	O
the	O
direction	O
you	O
are	O
turning	O
/	O
traveling	O
while	O
maintaining	O
equal	O
weight	O
on	O
your	O
seat	I
bones	I
.	O

Think	O
of	O
a	O
Barbie	O
doll	O
.	O

Twist	O
or	O
rotate	O
your	O
core	I
where	O
your	O
belt	O
would	O
be	O
located	O
,	O
bringing	O
your	O
arms	I
with	O
you	O
and	O
keeping	O
them	O
an	O
equal	O
distance	O
apart	O
as	O
you	O
do	O
this	O
.	O

Then	O
,	O
to	O
exit	O
the	O
turn	I
on	I
the	I
haunches	I
or	O
pirouette	I
,	O
all	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
do	O
is	O
straighten	O
your	O
core	I
.	O

If	O
you	O
have	O
too	O
much	O
weight	O
on	O
your	O
inside	I
seat	I
bone	I
,	O
your	O
horse	I
might	O
stick	O
/	O
stop	O
the	O
motion	O
and	O
pivot	O
with	O
his	O
inside	I
hind	I
leg	I
.	O

If	O
you	O
sit	O
to	O
the	O
outside	I
,	O
your	O
horse	I
is	O
less	O
likely	O
to	O
step	I
forward	I
and	O
under	O
and	O
will	O
most	O
likely	O
step	I
out	O
with	O
his	O
outside	I
hind	I
leg	I
.	O

Keep	O
the	O
distance	O
from	O
your	O
hip	I
to	O
your	O
underarm	I
the	O
same	O
on	O
both	O
sides	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
also	O
critical	O
that	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
pull	O
back	O
with	O
your	O
inside	I
rein	I
,	O
but	O
rather	O
guide	O
your	O
horse	I
's	O
shoulders	I
to	O
the	O
inside	I
by	O
shifting	O
your	O
hands	I
slightly	O
sideways	O
,	O
allowing	O
your	O
outside	I
rein	I
and	O
a	O
very	O
small	O
half	I
halt	I
to	O
initiate	O
the	O
movement	I
.	O

If	O
you	O
pull	O
back	O
on	O
the	O
inside	I
rein	I
,	O
you	O
might	O
get	O
resistance	O
.	O

This	O
resistance	O
can	O
show	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
horse	I
by	O
exhibiting	O
a	O
short	O
neck	I
,	O
a	O
dropped	O
poll	I
,	O
stiffening	O
,	O
loss	O
of	O
rhythm	I
and	O
an	O
unsteady	O
contact	I
.	O

Also	O
be	O
sure	O
not	O
to	O
allow	O
him	O
to	O
pop	O
the	O
outside	I
shoulder	I
.	O

Once	O
you	O
have	O
your	O
horse	I
on	I
the	I
aids	I
and	O
have	O
addressed	O
any	O
issues	O
in	O
your	O
position	O
,	O
check	O
that	O
your	O
horse	I
is	O
equally	O
supple	I
on	O
both	O
reins	I
.	O

Schooling	I
leg	I
yields	I
,	O
haunches-in	I
,	O
shoulder-in	I
and	O
renvers	I
at	O
the	O
walk	I
and	O
trot	I
helps	O
get	O
a	O
more	O
even	O
connection	I
.	O

Ask	O
yourself	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
control	O
of	O
your	O
horse	I
's	O
shoulders	I
and	O
haunches	I
in	O
these	O
exercises	I
.	O

Is	O
your	O
horse	I
in	O
balance	I
and	O
aligned	O
as	O
you	O
are	O
executing	O
these	O
movements	I
?	O

In	O
the	O
shoulder-in	I
are	O
your	O
horse	I
's	O
haunches	I
underneath	O
you	O
or	O
is	O
he	O
stepping	I
to	O
the	O
outside	I
?	O

In	O
the	O
haunches-in	I
be	O
sure	O
your	O
horse	I
is	O
truly	O
bending	I
,	O
not	O
escaping	O
through	O
his	O
shoulder	I
.	O

Take	O
note	O
of	O
which	O
side	O
is	O
easier	O
and	O
where	O
else	O
you	O
notice	O
the	O
issues	O
you	O
describe	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
easier	O
to	O
address	O
the	O
problem	O
by	O
utilizing	O
these	O
other	O
movements	I
mostly	O
in	O
trot	I
.	O

The	O
walk	I
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
hardest	O
gaits	I
to	O
address	O
and	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
be	O
sure	O
you	O
do	O
not	O
make	O
a	O
bigger	O
problem	O
in	O
attempting	O
to	O
fix	O
the	O
one	O
you	O
have	O
.	O

It	O
sounds	O
like	O
your	O
horse	I
is	O
not	O
connected	I
from	O
your	O
inside	I
leg	I
to	O
your	O
outside	I
rein	I
and	O
that	O
might	O
be	O
why	O
you	O
are	O
losing	O
suppleness	I
.	O

One	O
way	O
to	O
address	O
this	O
issue	O
is	O
by	O
schooling	I
quarter	I
turn	I
on	I
the	I
haunches	I
.	O

Ride	I
an	O
imaginary	O
square	O
with	O
the	O
corners	I
as	O
the	O
quarter	I
turn	I
.	O

This	O
exercise	I
will	O
reinforce	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
your	O
inside	I
leg	I
to	O
your	O
outside	I
rein	I
.	O

The	O
moment	O
you	O
feel	O
your	O
horse	I
stiffen	O
,	O
abort	O
the	O
pirouette	I
and	O
turn	O
it	O
into	O
a	O
leg	I
yield	I
,	O
softening	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
barrel	I
off	O
your	O
inside	I
leg	I
and	O
reconnecting	I
it	O
to	O
the	O
outside	I
rein	I
to	O
establish	O
suppleness	I
and	O
a	O
better	O
contact	I
.	O

When	O
you	O
take	O
your	O
horse	I
into	O
the	O
leg	I
yield	I
,	O
be	O
sure	O
you	O
do	O
it	O
in	O
balance	I
and	O
keep	O
his	O
alignment	O
.	O

When	O
you	O
get	O
comfortable	O
with	O
this	O
exercise	I
,	O
take	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
next	O
step	O
,	O
riding	I
a	O
quarter	I
turn	I
,	O
then	O
go	O
out	O
in	O
a	O
shoulder	I
fore	I
.	O

In	O
the	O
turn	I
on	I
the	I
haunches	I
,	O
make	O
sure	O
not	O
to	O
over-bend	I
your	O
horse	I
.	O

The	O
amount	O
of	O
bend	I
should	O
be	O
equal	O
to	O
the	O
bend	I
in	O
the	O
midline	O
of	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
chest	I
/	O
body	O
.	O

If	O
you	O
feel	O
like	O
your	O
horse	I
becomes	O
dull	O
to	O
the	O
leg	I
,	O
trot	I
out	O
of	O
the	O
quarter	I
turn	I
.	O

Remember	O
it	O
's	O
important	O
that	O
your	O
horse	I
is	O
always	O
forward	I
thinking	O
.	O

It	O
also	O
sounds	O
like	O
your	O
horse	I
might	O
be	O
stepping	I
wide	O
/	O
out	O
behind	O
rather	O
than	O
forward	I
and	O
under	O
.	O

Another	O
exercise	I
you	O
could	O
try	O
is	O
riding	I
a	O
haunches-in	I
at	O
the	O
walk	I
on	O
the	O
rail	I
,	O
then	O
turn	O
it	O
into	O
a	O
half	I
10-meter	I
circle	I
to	O
centerline	I
then	O
ride	I
straight	O
down	O
the	O
centerline	I
all	O
the	O
while	O
maintaining	O
the	O
haunches-in	I
.	O

This	O
will	O
help	O
your	O
horse	I
to	O
think	O
forward	I
and	O
sideways	I
,	O
improve	O
the	O
connection	I
from	O
the	O
inside	I
leg	I
to	O
the	O
outside	I
rein	I
and	O
inhibit	O
the	O
overuse	O
of	O
the	O
inside	I
rein	I
.	O

In	O
general	O
,	O
when	O
you	O
lose	O
suppleness	I
,	O
abort	O
the	O
movement—in	I
this	O
case	O
the	O
turn	I
on	I
the	I
haunches—and	I
address	O
the	O
real	O
issue	O
of	O
connection	I
.	O

Never	O
make	O
an	O
issue	O
within	O
a	O
movement	I
as	O
this	O
can	O
make	O
your	O
horse	I
tense	O
and	O
then	O
riding	I
the	O
movement	I
can	O
become	O
a	O
bigger	O
issue	O
