Katherine	I

The	O
angle	O
of	O
this	O

shows	O
the	O
size	O
of	O
both	O
horse	I
and	O
rider	I
and	O
it	O
shows	O
some	O
harmony	O
between	O
them	O

too	O

They	O
look	O

on	O
their	O
test	I

are	O
clearly	O

what	O
they	O
have	O

Riding	I
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
few	O
sports	O
where	O
you	O
can	O
see	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O
body	O
types	O
performing	O
well	O

I	O
can	O
imagine	O
how	O
much	O
it	O
meant	O
for	O
Katherine	I
to	O
rescue	O
this	O
horse	I
,	O
train	I
together	O
and	O
head	O
out	O
to	O

For	O
this	O
I	O
give	O
her	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
credit	O

While	O
the	O
saddle	I
looks	O
like	O
it	O
fits	O
the	O
horse	I
well	O
,	O
it	O
does	O
look	O
small	O
on	O
Katherine	I
.	O

Her	O
compromise	O
is	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
best	O
for	O
the	O
horse	I
first	O
.	O

The	O
horse	I
looks	O
in	O
good	O
condition	O
and	O
seems	O
to	O
work	O
happy	O
and	O
content	O
in	O
a	O
nice	O
frame	I
and	O
contact	I
.	O

Katherine	I
is	O
sitting	O
balanced	I
and	O
quiet	O
and	O
appears	O
to	O
ride	I
with	O
the	O
highest	O
concentration	O
.	O

Her	O
leg	I
position	O
shows	O
some	O
outside	O
rotation	O
,	O
which	O
might	O
be	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
shape	O
of	O
her	O
leg	I
.	O

Riders	I
with	O
short	O
and	O
round	O
thighs	I
might	O
have	O
a	O
very	O
hard	O
time	O
staying	O
supple	I
in	O
their	O
hips	I
when	O
rotating	O
the	O
leg	I
further	O
in	O
.	O

I	O
notice	O
that	O
she	O
is	O
slightly	O
looking	O
down	O
and	O
sitting	O
a	O
tiny	O
bit	O
forward	O
as	O
if	O
to	O
sit	O
lighter	O
on	O
her	O
horse	I
.	O

This	O
might	O
also	O
be	O
because	O
she	O
is	O
perhaps	O
in	O
the	O
sitting	O
moment	O
of	O
the	O
rising	I
trot	I
.	O

When	O
analyzing	O
riders	I
'	O
balance	I
,	O
I	O
often	O
compare	O
two	O
different	O
shapes	O
of	O
upper	O
body	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
look	O
at	O
a	O
rider	I
from	O
behind	O
,	O
some	O
look	O
like	O
a	O
V	O
with	O
a	O
narrow	O
pelvis	I
and	O
broad	O
shoulder	I
,	O
others	O
look	O
more	O
like	O
an	O
A	O
with	O
narrow	O
shoulders	I
and	O
a	O
broad	O
pelvis	I
.	O

Katherine	I
belongs	O
to	O
the	O
second	O
group	O
.	O

In	O
terms	O
of	O
balance	I
,	O
it	O
is	O
important	O
to	O
understand	O
what	O
that	O
means	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
challenge	O
to	O
balance	I
a	O
V	O
shape	O
.	O

In	O
contrast	O
,	O
the	O
A-shaped	O
body	O
has	O
a	O
much	O
more	O
secure	O
balance	I
,	O
and	O
that	O
often	O
makes	O
horses	I
feel	O
more	O
secure	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
balance	I
is	O
steady	O
,	O
even	O
the	O
weight	O
of	O
a	O
plus-size	O
rider	I
is	O
less	O
disturbing	O
than	O
the	O
weight	O
of	O
a	O
rider	I
who	O
is	O
unbalanced	I
and	O
insecure	O
.	O

Now	O
imagine	O
how	O
the	O
horse	I
will	O
feel	O
a	O
shift	O
of	O
weight	O
.	O

A	O
V-shaped	O
rider	I
will	O
have	O
to	O
move	O
only	O
a	O
tiny	O
bit	O
to	O
the	O
side	O
and	O
the	O
horse	I
will	O
feel	O
the	O
change	O
.	O

But	O
an	O
A-shaped	O
rider	I
will	O
have	O
to	O
move	O
much	O
more	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
same	O
effect	O
and	O
influence	O
on	O
the	O
horse	I
.	O

In	O
my	O
studies	O
of	O
physiotherapy	O
,	O
I	O
learned	O
to	O
pay	O
special	O
attention	O
to	O
the	O
body	O
's	O
diagonals	O
.	O

If	O
you	O
draw	O
a	O
diagonal	O
line	O
between	O
shoulders	I
and	O
hips	I
,	O
these	O
diagonals	O
resemble	O
our	O
diagonally	O
structured	O
muscles	I
,	O
and	O
all	O
our	O
movements	O
are	O
organized	O
in	O
sync	O
with	O
these	O
body	O
diagonals	O
.	O

If	O
you	O
look	O
at	O
photographs	O
from	O
all	O
different	O
sports	O
you	O
can	O
see	O
many	O
of	O
those	O
diagonal	O
movements	O
.	O

When	O
drawing	O
these	O
diagonals	O
into	O
a	O
body	O
,	O
they	O
cross	O
at	O
a	O
very	O
important	O
point	O
.	O

I	O
call	O
it	O
the	O
dynamic	O
center	O
of	O
the	O
body	O
.	O

This	O
center	O
is	O
not	O
equivalent	O
to	O
the	O
gravitational	O
center	O
of	O
the	O
body	O
.	O

Applying	O
this	O
to	O
the	O
A	O
-	O
and	O
V-shape	O
riders	I
shows	O
:	O

What	O
does	O
that	O
mean	O
for	O
riding	I
?	O

To	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
use	O
correct	O
seat	I
and	O
weight	I
aids	I
and	O
influence	O
the	O
horse	I
,	O
the	O
two	O
centers	O
need	O
to	O
connect	O
and	O
work	O
together	O
.	O

For	O
Katherine	I
it	O
means	O
that	O
if	O
she	O
moves	O
only	O
her	O
upper	O
body	O
,	O
she	O
moves	O
her	O
dynamic	O
area	O
but	O
there	O
will	O
be	O
no	O
shift	O
of	O
weight	O
that	O
the	O
horse	I
can	O
feel	O
.	O

Only	O
when	O
she	O
actively	O
connects	O
the	O
muscles	I
from	O
her	O
upper	O
body	O
with	O
her	O
pelvis	I
can	O
she	O
influence	O
the	O
horse	I
.	O

A	O
V-shaped	O
rider	I
may	O
move	O
much	O
more	O
in	O
the	O
pelvis	I
and	O
midsection	O
of	O
the	O
body	O
and	O
be	O
unable	O
to	O
give	O
precise	O
aids	I
(	O
because	O
of	O
instability	O
in	O
the	O
midsection	O
)	O
until	O
she	O
learns	O
to	O
connect	O
the	O
higher	O
gravity	O
center	O
with	O
the	O
movement	O
below	O
.	O

The	O
image	O
that	O
Katherine	I
needs	O
to	O
keep	O
in	O
mind	O
is	O
to	O
ride	I
thinking	O
that	O
she	O
wants	O
to	O
stretch	I
up	O
from	O
her	O
pelvis	I
,	O
connect	O
her	O
gravity	O
center	O
with	O
the	O
dynamic	O
center	O
and	O
broaden	O
her	O
shoulders	I
as	O
much	O
as	O
possible	O
.	O

Then	O
she	O
can	O
get	O
her	O
messages	O
across	O
to	O
the	O
horse	I
with	O
more	O
lightness	I
and	O
suppleness	I
.	O

This	O
may	O
allow	O
her	O
to	O
open	O
her	O
hip	I
joints	I
easier	O
and	O
improve	O
her	O
leg	I
position	O
.	O

I	O
wish	O
Katherine	I
and	O
her	O
horse	I
enjoyment	O
in	O
future	O
rides	I
together	O
.	O

Understanding	O
the	O
pros	O
and	O
cons	O
of	O
functional	O
anatomy	O
will	O
help	O
.	O

Then	O
the	O
riding	I
can	O
become	O
a	O
healthy	O
sport	O
for	O
both	O
of	O
them	O
