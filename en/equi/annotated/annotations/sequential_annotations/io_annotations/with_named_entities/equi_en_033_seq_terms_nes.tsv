Ehrlich	I
's	O
systematic	O
approach	O
to	O

starts	O
when	O
the	O

2	O
days	O

a	O

The	O
No.	O
1	O
goal	O
is	O
to	O
establish	O
trust	O
with	O

This	O
is	O
achieved	O
through	O

creating	O
a	O

for	O

When	O
Angel	I
arrived	O
at	O
Greengate	I
Farm	I
as	O
a	O
weanling	O
,	O
she	O
had	O
not	O
developed	O
her	O
frame	O

says	O
Ehrlich	I

She	O
was	O
sensitive	O

always	O
on	O

like	O
her	O

Angel	I
showed	O
this	O

up	O

Ehrlich	I
explains	O
:	O
It	O
was	O
as	O
if	O
she	O
was	O

Ehrlich	I
and	O
her	O

Michaela	I

started	O
Angel	I
with	O
short	O
sessions	O
of	O
five	O
to	O
10	O
minutes	O
,	O
sometimes	O
twice	O
a	O
day	O
,	O
at	O
first	O
just	O
standing	O
near	O
the	O
filly	I
to	O
build	O
trust	O
and	O
confidence	O

Then	O
they	O
'd	O
touch	O
her	O
and	O
put	O
her	O
halter	I
on	O
and	O
take	O
it	O
off	O

Angel	I
learned	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
a	O

with	O
us	O
for	O

Ehrlich	I

Like	O
many	O

Early	O
Lessons	O

The	O
early	O
lessons	O
consist	O
of	O
piggybacking	O
,	O
or	O
doing	O
a	O
little	O
at	O
a	O
time	O
to	O
create	O
trust	O

If	O
a	O
young	O
horse	I
trusts	O
me	O
in	O
something	O
,	O
then	O
OK	O
,	O
let	O
's	O
do	O
something	O
else	O
,	O
Ehrlich	I
explains	O
.	O

If	O
problems	O
arise	O
,	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
get	O
upset	O
.	O

We	O
just	O
decrease	O
the	O
stimulus	O
and	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
trust	O

safety	O
zone	O

We	O
increase	O

Leading	I
.	O

For	O
Angel	I
's	O
leading	I
lessons	O
,	O
two	O
handlers	I
were	O
involved	O
and	O
a	O
cotton	O
lead	I
rope	I
was	O
used	O
.	O

A	O
chain	O
is	O
inappropriate	O
for	O
a	O
yearling	I
,	O
but	O
if	O
you	O
need	O
extra	O
reinforcements	O
,	O
you	O
can	O
place	O
Vetwrap	I
over	O
the	O
chain	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
less	O
severe	O
and	O
then	O
take	O
the	O
chain	O
over	O
the	O
nose	I
and	O
diagonally	O
across	O
and	O
under	O
the	O
chin	I
to	O
stabilize	O
the	O

.	O

If	O
extra	O
control	O
is	O
needed	O
,	O
never	O
severely	O
shank	O
the	O

because	O
it	O
can	O

Angel	I
was	O
quick	O
to	O
learn	O
the	O
leading	I
lesson	O

However	O
,	O
if	O
a	O
youngster	O
refuses	O
to	O
go	O
forward	O
,	O
pulling	O
on	O
the	O
lead	O
creates	O
pressure	O
behind	O
the	O
poll	I
,	O
causing	O
panic	O
,	O
and	O
using	O
a	O
whip	I
can	O
incite	O
fear	O
.	O

Instead	O
,	O
one	O
handler	I
stands	O
at	O
the	O
head	I
and	O
the	O
other	O
at	O
the	O
side	O
,	O
pushing	O
the	O
youngster	O
forward	O
with	O
a	O
hand	I
on	O
the	O
thigh	I
or	O
by	O
using	O
a	O
butt	I
rope	I
.	O

Take	O
a	O
second	O
lead	I
rope	I
long	O
enough	O
to	O
cross	O
over	O
the	O
youngster	O
's	O
back	I
and	O
pass	O
it	O
under	O
the	O
tail	I
to	O
lie	O
over	O
the	O
thighs—creating	I
a	O
figure	O
eight—and	O
apply	O
gentle	O
pressure	O

Be	O
sure	O
the	O
youngster	O
accepts	O
being	O
touched	O
before	O
introducing	O
the	O
butt	I
rope	I

If	O
the	O
youngster	O
still	O
refuses	O
to	O
go	O
forward	O
,	O
try	O
moving	O
in	O
a	O
zigzag	O
line	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
bent	O
neck	I
makes	O
it	O
harder	O

If	O
the	O

Angel	I
systematically	O
learned	O
to	O
be	O
tied	O
and	O
to	O
stand	O
still	O

While	O
eating	O
,	O
she	O
was	O
initially	O

with	O
the	O

only	O
looped	O
through	O
the	O

in	O
her	O

in	O
case	O
she	O
panicked	O
and	O
pulled	O
back	O

Later	O
,	O
the	O
lead	O
was	O
tied	O
in	O
a	O
quick-release	O
knot	O
for	O
short	O
periods	O
with	O
someone	O
nearby	O

Standing	O

Angel	I
learned	O
to	O
stand	O
and	O
understand	O
voice	O
commands	O
of	O
whoa	O
or	O
stand	O
together	O
with	O
a	O
slight	O
tug	O
on	O
the	O

If	O
Angel	I
moved	O
,	O
she	O
was	O
immediately	O
corrected	O
,	O
returned	O
to	O
the	O
designated	O
spot	O
and	O
the	O
voice	O
command	O
repeated	O

She	O
had	O
to	O
stand	O
for	O
only	O
a	O
few	O
seconds	O
before	O
being	O
praised	I
and	O
then	O
led	O
forward	O
again	O

Over	O
time	O

she	O
stood	O
for	O
longer	O
periods	O

Blanketing	O

Ehrlich	I
introduces	O
all	O
her	O
foals	I
to	O
the	O
blanket	O
,	O
and	O
Angel	I
needed	O
only	O
a	O
quick	O
introduction	O
.	O

First	O
she	O
sniffed	O
it	O
,	O
then	O
it	O
touched	O
her	O
shoulder	I
and	O
was	O
stroked	O
over	O
her	O
neck	I
,	O
legs	I
and	O
back	I

The	O
blanket	O
was	O
then	O
folded	O
into	O
a	O
small	O
oblong	O

draped	O
on	O
her	O
withers	I
and	O
slowly	O
unfolded	O

one	O

at	O
a	O

Each	O
step	O
proceeds	O
only	O
when	O
the	O

Vacuuming	O

Gradually	O
,	O
Angel	I
was	O
introduced	O
to	O
scary	O
new	O
challenges	O
like	O
the	O
vacuum	O
.	O

First	O
,	O
she	O
heard	O
the	O
noise	O
,	O
next	O
she	O
was	O
touched	O
with	O
the	O

equipment	O
,	O
then	O
she	O
saw	O
another	O
horse	I
vacuumed	O
and	O
,	O
finally	O
,	O
she	O
was	O
vacuumed	O

Likewise	O

she	O
became	O
accustomed	O
to	O
the	O
hose	O

For	O
water	O

she	O
first	O
saw	O
the	O

then	O
it	O
was	O
turned	O

gradually	O

run	O
over	O

If	O

Never	O
tie	O

during	O
these	O

due	O
to	O

Remember	O

the	O

First	O
the	O

A	O

with	O

Be	O

With	O
a	O
two-horse	I

it	O
is	O
best	O
to	O
transport	O
the	O

in	O
a	O

introduce	O
the	O

ca	O
n't	O
escape	O

Another	O
option	O
is	O
to	O
create	O
a	O

the	O

After	O
each	O
session	O
,	O
Angel	I
rejoined	O
her	O

in	O
the	O
field	O

She	O
learned	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
work	O
time	O
and	O
play	O
time	O

Having	O
playmates	O
of	O
a	O

allows	O
youngsters	O
to	O
learn	O

and	O
teaches	O
them	O
about	O

But	O
in	O
training	I

it	O
is	O
the	O

that	O
ultimately	O
must	O
be	O
the	O

The	O
earlier	O

this	O

The	O
goal	O
is	O
to	O
build	O
a	O
strong	O
relationship	O
of	O
respect	O
and	O
trust	O
between	O

the	O
partnership	O
is	O

Ideally	O

the	O

should	O
be	O

That	O

what	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
keep	O
you	O

in	O
the	O

You	O

Operant	I

is	O
a	O
term	O
coined	O
by	O
behaviorist	O
B.F.	I
Skinner	I
in	O
1938	O
.	O

According	O
to	O
Skinner	I
's	O
premise	O

behavior	O
is	O
strengthened	O
when	O
followed	O
by	O
positive	O
reinforcement	O
and	O
weakened	O
when	O
followed	O
by	O
punishment	O

For	O
Ehrlich	I

it	O
is	O
less	O
about	O
punishment	O

more	O
about	O
reward	I

If	O

is	O
a	O

They	O
need	O
to	O

us	O

they	O
are	O

with	O
thoughtful	O

training	I
long	O
before	O

our	O

I	O

it	O
