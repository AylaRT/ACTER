Airs	I

The	O
airs	I
above	I
the	I
ground	I
or	O
school	I
jumps	I
are	O
a	O
series	O
of	O
higher-level	O
,	O
Haute	I
ecole	I
,	O
classical	I
dressage	I
movements	I
in	O
which	O
the	O
horse	I
leaves	O
the	O
ground	O
.	O

They	O
include	O
the	O
capriole	I
,	O
the	O
courbette	I
,	O
the	O
mezair	I
,	O
the	O
croupade	I
and	O
the	O
levade	I
.	O

None	O
are	O
typically	O
seen	O
in	O
modern	O
competitive	I
dressage	I
.	O

They	O
are	O
performed	O
by	O
horses	I
of	O
various	O
riding	I
academies	O
such	O
as	O
the	O
Spanish	I
Riding	I
School	I
in	O
Vienna	I
and	O
the	O
Cadre	I
Noir	I
in	O
Saumur	I
,	O
and	O
may	O
be	O
seen	O
in	O
other	O
dressage	I
performances	O
.	O

The	O
levade	I
and	O
courbette	I
are	O
a	O
particular	O
feature	O
of	O
the	O
Doma	I
Menorquina	I
,	O
the	O
riding	I
tradition	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Menorca	I
.	O

Horses	I
such	O
as	O
the	O
Andalusian	I
,	O
Lusitano	I
,	O
Lipizzan	I
and	O
Menorquín	I
are	O
the	O
breeds	I
most	O
often	O
trained	I
to	O
perform	O
the	O
airs	I
today	O
,	O
in	O
part	O
due	O
to	O
their	O
powerfully	O
conformed	O
hindquarters	I
,	O
which	O
allow	O
them	O
the	O
strength	O
to	O
perform	O
these	O
difficult	O
movements	I
.	O

There	O
were	O
originally	O
seven	O
airs	I
,	O
many	O
of	O
which	O
were	O
used	O
to	O
build	O
into	O
the	O
movements	I
performed	O
today	O
.	O

There	O
is	O
a	O
popular	O
conception	O
that	O
these	O
movements	I
were	O
originally	O
taught	O
to	O
horses	I
for	O
military	O
purposes	O
,	O
and	O
indeed	O
both	O
the	O
Spanish	I
Riding	I
School	I
and	O
the	O
Cadre	I
Noir	I
are	O
military	O
foundations	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
while	O
agility	O
was	O
necessary	O
on	O
the	O
battlefield	O
,	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
airs	I
as	O
performed	O
today	O
would	O
have	O
exposed	O
the	O
vulnerable	O
underbelly	I
of	O
the	O
horse	I
to	O
the	O
weapons	O
of	O
foot	O
soldiers	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
therefore	O
more	O
likely	O
that	O
the	O
airs	I
were	O
exercises	I
to	O
develop	O
the	O
military	O
horse	I
and	O
rider	I
,	O
rather	O
than	O
to	O
be	O
employed	O
in	O
combat	O
.	O

Horses	I
are	O
usually	O
taught	O
each	O
air	I
on	O
the	O
long	I
rein	I
without	O
a	O
rider	I
,	O
which	O
is	O
less	O
strenuous	O
for	O
the	O
animal	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
each	O
movement	I
is	O
meant	O
to	O
eventually	O
be	O
performed	O
under	O
a	O
rider	I
.	O

The	O
pesade	I
and	O
the	O
levade	I

The	O
pesade	I
and	O
levade	I
are	O
the	O
first	O
airs	I
taught	O
to	O
the	O
High	I
School	I
horse	I
,	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
from	O
these	O
that	O
all	O
other	O
airs	I
are	O
taught	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
pesade	I
,	O
the	O
horse	I
raises	O
its	O
forehand	I
off	O
the	O
ground	O
and	O
tucks	O
the	O
forelegs	I
evenly	O
,	O
carrying	O
all	O
weight	O
on	O
the	O
hindquarters	I
,	O
to	O
form	O
a	O
45	O
degree	O
angle	O
with	O
the	O
ground	O
.	O

The	O
levade	I
was	O
first	O
taught	O
at	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
the	O
20th	O
century	O
,	O
asking	O
the	O
horse	I
to	O
hold	O
a	O
position	O
approximately	O
30–35	O
degrees	O
from	O
the	O
ground	O
.	O

Unlike	O
the	O
pesade	I
,	O
which	O
is	O
more	O
of	O
a	O
test	O
of	O
balance	I
,	O
the	O
decreased	O
angle	O
makes	O
the	O
levade	I
an	O
extremely	O
strenuous	O
position	O
to	O
hold	O
,	O
and	O
requires	O
a	O
greater	O
effort	O
from	O
the	O
horse	I
.	O

Therefore	O
,	O
many	O
horses	I
are	O
not	O
capable	O
of	O
a	O
good-quality	O
levade	I
.	O

The	O
levade	I
is	O
also	O
a	O
transition	O
movement	I
between	O
work	I
on	I
the	I
ground	I
and	O
the	O
airs	I
above	I
the	I
ground	I
.	O

Neither	O
of	O
these	O
movements	I
are	O
equivalent	O
to	O
rearing	I
,	O
as	O
they	O
require	O
precise	O
control	O
,	O
excellent	O
balance	I
,	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
strength	O
,	O
and	O
are	O
the	O
product	O
of	O
correct	O
training	I
,	O
rather	O
than	O
resistance	O
from	O
the	O
horse	I
.	O

The	O
horse	I
is	O
asked	O
to	O
enter	O
the	O
pesade	I
or	O
levade	I
from	O
the	O
piaffe	I
,	O
which	O
asks	O
the	O
horse	I
to	O
increasingly	O
engage	I
its	O
hindquarters	I
,	O
lowering	O
them	O
toward	O
the	O
ground	O
and	O
bringing	O
the	O
hind	I
legs	I
more	O
toward	O
its	O
center	O
of	O
gravity	O
.	O

This	O
gives	O
the	O
viewer	O
the	O
impression	O
that	O
the	O
horse	I
appears	O
to	O
sink	O
down	O
in	O
back	O
and	O
rise	O
in	O
front	O
.	O

The	O
position	O
is	O
held	O
for	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
seconds	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
the	O
horse	I
quietly	O
puts	O
the	O
forelegs	I
back	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
and	O
proceeds	O
at	O
the	O
walk	I
,	O
or	O
stands	O
at	O
the	O
halt	I
.	O

The	O
levade	I
is	O
considered	O
to	O
be	O
pinnacle	O
of	O
collection	I
,	O
as	O
the	O
horse	I
carries	O
all	O
weight	O
on	O
the	O
back	I
legs	I
,	O
and	O
has	O
an	O
extreme	O
tucking	I
of	I
the	I
hindquarters	I
and	O
coiling	I
of	I
the	I
loins	I
.	O

The	O
capriole	I
,	O
the	O
croupade	I
and	O
the	O
ballotade	I

In	O
the	O
capriole	I
(	O
meaning	O
leap	O
of	O
a	O
goat	O
)	O
,	O
the	O
horse	I
jumps	I
from	O
a	O
raised	O
position	O
of	O
the	O
forehand	I
straight	O
up	O
into	O
the	O
air	O
,	O
kicks	I
out	O
with	O
the	O
hind	I
legs	I
,	O
and	O
lands	O
more	O
or	O
less	O
on	O
all	O
four	O
legs	I
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
.	O

It	O
requires	O
an	O
enormously	O
powerful	O
horse	I
to	O
perform	O
correctly	O
,	O
and	O
is	O
considered	O
the	O
most	O
difficult	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
airs	I
above	I
the	I
ground	I
.	O

It	O
is	O
first	O
introduced	O
with	O
the	O
croupade	I
,	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
horse	I
does	O
not	O
kick	I
out	O
at	O
the	O
height	O
of	O
elevation	I
,	O
but	O
keeps	O
the	O
hind	I
legs	I
tucked	O
tightly	O
under	O
,	O
and	O
remains	O
parallel	O
to	O
the	O
ground	O
.	O

The	O
horse	I
is	O
then	O
taught	O
the	O
ballotade	I
.	O

In	O
this	O
movement	I
,	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
hind	I
hooves	I
are	O
positioned	O
so	O
one	O
can	O
see	O
its	O
shoes	I
if	O
watching	O
from	O
behind	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
horse	I
is	O
not	O
asked	O
to	O
kick	I
out	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
horse	I
demonstrates	O
proficiency	O
in	O
the	O
ballotade	I
,	O
the	O
capriole	I
is	O
introduced	O
.	O

The	O
courbette	I

In	O
the	O
courbette	I
,	O
the	O
horse	I
raises	O
its	O
forehand	I
off	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
tucks	O
up	O
forelegs	I
evenly	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
jumps	I
forward	O
,	O
never	O
allowing	O
the	O
forelegs	I
to	O
touch	O
down	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
series	O
of	O
hops	O
.	O

Extremely	O
strong	O
and	O
talented	O
horses	I
can	O
perform	O
five	O
or	O
more	O
leaps	O
forward	O
before	O
having	O
to	O
touch	O
down	O
with	O
the	O
forelegs	I
,	O
although	O
it	O
is	O
more	O
usual	O
to	O
see	O
a	O
series	O
of	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
leaps	O
.	O

The	O
courbette	I
,	O
like	O
the	O
capriole	I
,	O
is	O
first	O
introduced	O
through	O
the	O
easier	O
croupade	I
.	O

Mezair	I

In	O
the	O
mezair	I
,	O
the	O
horse	I
rears	I
up	I
and	O
strikes	O
out	O
with	O
its	O
forelegs	I
.	O

It	O
is	O
similar	O
to	O
a	O
series	O
of	O
levades	I
with	O
a	O
forward	I
motion	I
(	O
not	O
in	O
place	O
)	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
horse	I
gradually	O
bringing	O
its	O
legs	I
further	O
under	O
himself	O
in	O
each	O
successive	O
movement	I
and	O
lightly	O
touching	O
the	O
ground	O
with	O
the	O
front	I
legs	I
before	O
pushing	O
up	O
again	O
.	O

The	O
mezair	I
was	O
originally	O
called	O
the	O
courbette	I
by	O
the	O
old	O
dressage	I
masters	I

It	O
is	O
no	O
