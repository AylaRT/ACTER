a	O

It	O

a	O

the	O

The	O

Depending	O
on	O
the	O
horse	I
and	O
its	O
speed	O
,	O
a	O
trot	I
can	O
be	O
difficult	O
for	O
a	O
rider	I
to	O
sit	I
because	O
the	O
body	O
of	O
the	O
horse	I
actually	O
drops	O
a	O
bit	O
between	O
beats	I
and	O
bounces	O
up	O
again	O
when	O
the	O
next	O

another	O
diagonal	O

the	O
rider	I
can	O
be	O
jolted	O
upwards	O
out	O

meet	O
the	O

with	O
some	O

Sitting	I
the	O

gives	O
the	O

Half-seat	I

Sometimes	O

the	O
