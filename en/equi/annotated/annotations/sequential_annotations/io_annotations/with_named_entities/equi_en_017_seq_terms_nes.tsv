I	O

Some	O

it	O
with	O
a	O
lot	O

Some	O
ask	O
the	O

A	O
:	O
This	O
is	O
a	O
wonderful	O
question	O
for	O
me	O
as	O
I	O
use	O
the	O
turn	I
on	I
the	I
forehand	I
a	O
lot	O
.	O

I	O
think	O
what	O
you	O
are	O
observing	O
are	O
variations	O
of	O
the	O
exercise	I
more	O
than	O
different	O
versions	O
.	O

Turns	I
on	I
the	I
forehand	I
are	O
basically	O
lateral	I
movements	I
.	O

We	O
teach	O
them	O
because	O
they	O
promote	O
suppleness	I
and	O
obedience	I
.	O

A	O
certain	O
degree	O
of	O
obedience	I
and	O
submission	I
is	O
necessary	O
to	O
perform	O
this	O
exercise	I
.	O

A	O
larger	O
circle	O
of	O
the	O
front	I
feet	I
and	O
more	O
bend	I
throughout	O
the	O
body	O
are	O
easier	O
than	O
a	O
smaller	O
circle	O
and	O
less	O
bend	I
throughout	O
the	O
body	O
with	O
the	O
front	I
feet	I
staying	O
more	O
on	O
the	O
spot	O
.	O

The	O
smaller	O
diameter	O
of	O
the	O
forehand	I
turn	I
with	O
less	O
bend	I
requires	O
that	O
the	O
horse	I
has	O
learned	O
how	O
to	O
stay	O
in	O
a	O
frame	I
and	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
is	O
reliably	O
obedient	I
to	O
the	O
driving	I
aids	I
and	O
submissive	O
to	O
the	O
rein	I
aids	I
.	O

He	O
has	O
learned	O
to	O
respond	O
to	O
a	O
complex	O
combination	O
of	O
aids	I

He	O
can	O

Go	O

much	O
on	O
the	O

While	O

We	O
are	O
talking	O
about	O
collection	I
here	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
offer	O
that	O
the	O
smaller	O
turn	I
on	I
the	I
forehand	I
is	O
being	O
done	O
by	O
a	O
horse	I
who	O
is	O
more	O
advanced	O
in	O
his	O
training	I
.	O

Since	O
progress	O
can	O
be	O
measured	O
by	O
the	O
degree	O
of	O
collection	I
a	O
horse	I
is	O
capable	O
of	O
,	O
the	O
turn	I
on	I
the	I
forehand	I
is	O
a	O
good	O
indicator	O
of	O
where	O
the	O
horse	I
is	O
in	O
his	O
education	O
.	O

Training	I
the	O
turn	I
on	I
the	I
forehand	I
helps	O
horses	I
understand	O
the	O
bending	I
and	O
the	O
straightening	I
aids	I
.	O

I	O
find	O
it	O
the	O
crucible	O
of	O
their	O
dressage	I
education	O
.	O

A	O
more	O
advanced	O
horse	I
will	O
exemplify	O
the	O
concepts	O
of	O
the	O
training	I
scale	I
:	O
a	O
clear	O
walk	I
rhythm	I
,	O
relaxation	I
,	O
a	O
supple	I
connection	I
to	O
the	O
outside	I
rein	I
and	O
a	O
willingness	O
to	O
be	O
straightened	I
.	O

Referring	O
to	O
the	O
easier	O
variation	O
of	O
the	O
turn	I
on	I
the	I
forehand	I
,	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
front	I
legs	I
describe	O
a	O
larger	O
circle	O
and	O
the	O
horse	I
is	O
allowed	O
some	O
bend	I
to	O
the	O
inside	I
,	O
that	O
horse	I
could	O
be	O
at	O
an	O
earlier	O
stage	O
of	O
his	O
education	O
.	O

Very	O
soon	O
in	O
his	O
career	O
,	O
a	O
dressage	I
horse	I
will	O
have	O
to	O
perform	O
movements	I
on	O
two	O
tracks	I
,	O
or	O
lateral	I
movements	I
.	O

Crossing	O
the	O
front	O
and	O
back	I
legs	I
can	O
be	O
confusing	O
to	O
the	O
horse	I
.	O

I	O
teach	O
lateral	I
exercises	I
in	O
the	O
walk	I
so	O
the	O
horse	I
learns	O
the	O
response	O
to	O
the	O
aids	I
without	O
losing	O
his	O
balance	I
.	O

All	O
trainers	I
have	O
a	O
system	O
they	O
have	O
developed	O
that	O
asks	O
the	O
horse	I
to	O
obey	O
simple	O
aids	I
:	O
the	O
leg	I
aids	I
,	O
which	O
mean	O
go	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
rein	I
aids	I
,	O
which	O
mean	O
stop	O
or	O
turn	O
.	O

Eventually	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
necessary	O
to	O
combine	O
these	O
aids	I
in	O
a	O
way	O
that	O
produces	O
a	O
more	O
complex	O
crossing	O
of	O
the	O
legs	I
and	O
bending	I
of	O
the	O
body	O
.	O

Once	O
the	O
horse	I
is	O
comfortable	O
with	O
the	O
driving	I
and	O
turning	I
aids	I
in	O
trot	I
and	O
canter	I
,	O
I	O
start	O
asking	O
for	O
the	O
turn	I
on	I
the	I
forehand	I
in	O
the	O
walk	I
.	O

I	O
ride	I
a	O
10-meter	I
circle	I
and	O
ask	O
the	O
hind	I
legs	I
to	O
cross	O
to	O
the	O
outside	I
.	O

In	O
the	O
beginning	O
,	O
I	O
hold	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
head	I
to	O
the	O
inside	I
with	O
the	O
inside	I
rein	I
.	O

I	O
use	O
the	O
whip	I
gently	O
on	O
the	O
flank	I
to	O
get	O
the	O
hindquarters	I
to	O
move	O
away	O
from	O
pressure	O
.	O

I	O
combine	O
that	O
with	O
a	O
cluck	I
of	O
my	O
tongue	I
,	O
and	O
soon	O
the	O
horse	I
will	O
move	O
away	O
from	O
a	O
very	O
light	O
pressure	O
on	O
his	O
side	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
early	O
stages	O
,	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
care	O
how	O
much	O
the	O
horse	I
bends	I
his	O
neck	I
because	O
I	O
want	O
him	O
to	O
concentrate	O
on	O
obedience	I
to	O
the	O
leg	I
aid	I
.	O

Once	O
he	O
obeys	O
the	O
leg	I
aid	I
consistently	O
,	O
I	O
start	O
to	O
add	O
the	O
outside	I
rein	I
to	O
limit	O
the	O
degree	O
of	O
bend	I
throughout	O
the	O
whole	O
length	O
of	O
the	O
body	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
horse	I
can	O
comfortably	O
move	O
around	O
my	O
inside	I
leg	I
,	O
I	O
start	O
to	O
ask	O
for	O
even	O
more	O
straightness	I
laterally	O
.	O

That	O
creates	O
more	O
crossing	O
of	O
the	O
hind	I
legs	I
and	O
therefore	O
has	O
a	O
greater	O
suppling	I
effect	O
on	O
the	O
loin	I
muscles	I
.	O

When	O
the	O
straightness	I
becomes	O
too	O
difficult	O
,	O
I	O
relax	O
the	O
outside	I
rein	I
a	O
bit	O
.	O

When	O
teaching	O
the	O
turn	I
on	I
the	I
forehand	I
,	O
I	O
do	O
it	O
continually	O
until	O
the	O
horse	I
finds	O
his	O
balance	I
and	O
is	O
confident	O
in	O
the	O
exercise	I
.	O

Gradually	O
,	O
I	O
reduce	O
the	O
diameter	O
of	O
the	O
circle	I
so	O
that	O
the	O
front	I
legs	I
stay	O
more	O
on	O
the	O
spot	O
and	O
I	O
limit	O
the	O
degree	O
of	O
bend	I
.	O

When	O
the	O
horse	I
accepts	O
making	O
the	O
circle	I
smaller	O
,	O
he	O
has	O
started	O
to	O
understand	O
a	O
lot	O
more	O
about	O
accepting	O
the	O
aids	I
,	O
which	O
will	O
produce	O
collection	I
.	O

As	O
with	O
everything	O
new	O
,	O
patient	O
repetition	O
is	O
the	O
key	O
.	O

Of	O
course	O
,	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
do	O
the	O
exercise	I
on	O
both	O
sides	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
side	O
will	O
always	O
be	O
better	O
than	O
the	O
other	O
.	O

When	O
a	O
horse	I
can	O
be	O
adjusted	O
from	O
a	O
big	O
circle	I
to	O
a	O
smaller	O
one	O
,	O
I	O
feel	O
an	O
important	O
plateau	O
has	O
been	O
reached	O
.	O

The	O
horse	I
and	O
I	O
have	O
reached	O
a	O
higher	O
level	O
of	O
cooperation	O
and	O
respect	O
