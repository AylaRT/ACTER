What	O

It	O
?	O

The	O
leg	I
yield	I
is	O
an	O
exercise	I
done	O
at	O
the	O
walk	I
and	O
trot	I
.	O

The	O
horse	I
should	O
not	O
have	O
bend	I
in	O
the	O
body	O
as	O
he	O
moves	O
sideways	I
away	O
from	O
the	O
direction	O
of	O
his	O
flexion	I
.	O

The	O
horse	I
's	O
front	I

legs	I
should	O
cross	O
in	O

of	O
the	O
leg	I

I	O
remind	O

to	O
feel	O
an	O
even	O
contact	I
on	O
both	O
reins	I
during	O
the	O
leg	I

the	O
horse	I

The	O
priority	O
in	O
the	O
leg	I

is	O
to	O
first	O
supple	I
the	O
body	O

Then	O
I	O
make	O

there	O
is	O
correct	O

There	O
are	O

:	O

•	O
The	O
leg	I
yield	I
is	O
a	O
gymnastic	I
exercise	I
for	O
the	O
horse	I
because	O
his	O
legs	I
cross	I
over	I
one	O
another	O
to	O
loosen	O
the	O
body	O
.	O

The	O
muscles	I
and	O
joints	I
warm	O
up	O
and	O
stretch	I
during	O
the	O
leg	I
yield	I
to	O
help	O
the	O
horse	I
become	O
supple	I
,	O
which	O
then	O
allows	O
him	O
to	O

the	O
horse	I
's	O
sides	O
with	O
your	O
leg	I

•	O
You	O
develop	O
the	O

because	O
you	O
move	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
inside	I
hind	I
leg	I
to	O
the	O
outside	I

During	O
and	O
after	O
the	O

the	O
goal	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
horse	I
has	O
an	O
even	O

from	O
the	O

Aids	I

The	O
leg	I
yield	I
along	O
the	O
wall	I
is	O
a	O
good	O
place	O
to	O
learn	O
and	O
perfect	O
the	O
aids	I
for	O
the	O
leg	I
yield	I
.	O

Begin	O
with	O
the	O
horse	I
at	O
a	O
regular	O
rhythm	I
and	O
tempo	I
in	O
the	O
medium	I
walk	I
to	O
the	O
right	O
on	O
the	O
second	I
track	I
or	O
slightly	O
off	O
the	O
wall	I
.	O

Keep	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
neck	I
straight	O
on	O
the	O
long	I
side	I
and	O
ask	O
for	O
slight	O
left	I
flexion	I
.	O

Next	O
,	O
use	O
the	O
left	I
leg	I
and	O
seat	I
bone	I
to	O
ask	O
the	O
horse	I
to	O
bring	O
his	O
haunches	I
in	O
toward	O
the	O
center	O
of	O
the	O
ring	I
while	O
his	O
shoulders	I
stay	O
on	O
the	O
second	I
track	I
.	O

He	O
should	O
walk	I
at	O
about	O
a	O
30-degree	O
angle	O
along	O
the	O
wall	I
.	O

Feel	O
your	O
leg	I
asking	O
in	O
the	O
rhythm	I
of	O
the	O
walk	I
for	O
each	O
step	I
,	O
not	O
just	O
a	O
constant	O
squeeze	O
.	O

If	O
the	O
horse	I
does	O
not	O
respond	O
well	O
to	O
your	O
leg	I
,	O
use	O
a	O
tickle	O
of	O
the	O
spur	I
or	O
whip	I
to	O
send	O
him	O
sideways	I
.	O

Simultaneously	O
,	O
keep	O
the	O
contact	I
even	O
on	O
both	O
reins	I
and	O
use	O
squeezes	O
on	O
the	O
right	I
rein	I
to	O
keep	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
body	O
straight	I

Think	O
of	O
the	O
left	I
hind	I
leg	I
stepping	I
into	O
the	O
right	I
rein	I
as	O
you	O
receive	O
that	O
connection	I

Make	O
sure	O
your	O
body	O
is	O
straight	O
and	O
pointed	O
toward	O
the	O
wall	I
at	O
the	O
same	O
angle	O
as	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
chest	I

When	O
you	O
get	O
to	O
the	O
corner	I

use	O
this	O
exercise	I
in	O
the	O
warm-up	I

up	O
my	O
horse	I

Try	O
it	O

Advanced	O
Exercise	I

Leg	I
yield	I
in	O
and	O
out	O
on	O
a	O
20-meter	I
circle	I
is	O
more	O
difficult	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
makes	O
the	O
horse	I
even	O
more	O
supple	I
and	O
improves	O
the	O
connection	I
.	O

Once	O
you	O
and	O
the	O
horse	I
understand	O
the	O
aids	I
of	O
leg	I
yield	I
along	O
the	O
wall	I
,	O
begin	O
on	O
an	O
18-meter	I
circle	I
at	O
the	O
medium	I
walk	I
or	O
working	I
trot	I
tracking	I
left	O

Because	O
the	O
circle	I
is	O
so	O
big	O
,	O
the	O
horse	I
is	O
only	O
bent	I
slightly	O
to	O
the	O
inside	I

Use	O
the	O
aid	I
for	O
leg	I
yield	I
from	O
the	O
left	I
leg	I
and	O
carefully	O
push	O
the	O
horse	I
out	O
onto	O
the	O
20-meter	I
circle	I

On	O
the	O
20-meter	I
circle	I
,	O
straighten	I
the	O
horse	I
and	O
change	O
the	O
flexion	I
to	O
the	O
right	O

in	O
from	O
the	O
right	I
leg	I

these	O
questions	O
:	O

•	O
Does	O
my	O

Try	O
the	O

Use	O
the	O
feeling	O
from	O
the	O

connect	I
the	O

on	O
any	O

where	O
he	O

In	O

if	O
you	O

to	O
push	O
him	O
out	O

keep	O
him	O

Or	O
if	O
he	O
falls	I
out	I
