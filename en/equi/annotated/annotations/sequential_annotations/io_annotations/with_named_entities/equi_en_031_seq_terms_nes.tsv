10	O
tips	O
to	O
improve	O
the	O
lengthening	I
:	O

1	O
.	O

The	O
lengthening	I
is	O
a	O
whole-bodied	O
movement	O
for	O
your	O
horse...that	I
is	O
,	O
it	O
must	O
go	O
from	O
thrusting	I
hind	I
feet	I
all	O
the	O
way	O
to	O
the	O
bit	I
.	O

2	O
.	O

Expect	O
your	O
horse	I
to	O
reach	O
for	O
the	O
bridle	I
in	O
the	O
lengthening	I
.	O

Reach	O
is	O
the	O
operative	O
word	O
.	O

Allow	O
his	O
whole	O
body--not	O
just	O
his	O
strides--to	I
lengthen	I
.	O

Soften	O
your	O
hand	I
so	O
he	O
feels	O
he	O
can	O
reach	O
,	O
but	O
do	O
n't	O
throw	O
away	O
the	O
contact	I
.	O

3	O
.	O

The	O
lengthening	I
should	O
stabilize	O
the	O
contact	I
without	O
making	O
it	O
heavy	O
or	O
inflexible	O
.	O

Your	O
horse	I
should	O
still	O
be	O
responsive	O
to	O
slight	O
suppling	I
aids	I
to	O
the	O
left	O
and	O
right	O
.	O

4	O
.	O

Lengthenings	I
can	O
only	O
be	O
developed	O
from	O
a	O
correct	O
working	I
trot	I
.	O

5	O
.	O

Be	O
very	O
picky	O
and	O
precise	O
about	O
your	O
line	I
of	I
travel	I
during	O
the	O
lengthening	I
so	O
that	O
your	O
horse	I
's	O
effort	O
goes	O
through	O
his	O
body	O
.	O

6	O
.	O

You	O
should	O
feel	O
suspension	I
in	O
the	O
lengthening	I
.	O

7	O
.	O

Keep	O
the	O
same	O
tempo	I
in	O
the	O
lengthening	I
,	O
even	O
if	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
get	O
the	O
amount	O
of	O
reach	O
that	O
you	O
want	O
.	O

If	O
your	O
horse	I
gets	O
fast	O
,	O
he	O
has	O
lost	O
his	O
balance	I
onto	O
the	O
forehand	I
.	O

If	O
it	O
feels	O
slightly	O
slower	O
,	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
good	O
sign	O
because	O
it	O
takes	O
longer	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
big	O
stride	I
than	O
it	O
does	O
to	O
take	O
a	O
small	O
stride	I
.	O

.	O

If	O
your	O
horse	I
loses	O
his	O
balance	I
in	O
the	O
lengthening	I
,	O
half	I
halt	I
and	O
circle	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
back	O
.	O

9	O
.	O

Incorporate	O
suppling	I
exercises	I
with	O
all	O
lengthenings	I
so	O
your	O
horse	I
does	O
n't	O
get	O
stiff	O
and	O
difficult	O
in	O
the	O
downward	I
transitions	I
.	O

For	O
example	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
diagonal	I
line	I
,	O
you	O
can	O
do	O
a	O
few	O
steps	I
of	O
leg	I
yield	I
in	O
the	O
middle	O
or	O
toward	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
lengthening	I
.	O

Be	O
sure	O
your	O
horse	I
's	O
shoulders	I
stay	O
on	O
the	O
exact	O
diagonal	I
line	I
.	O

Do	O
n't	O
expect	O
to	O
get	O
your	O
best	O
lengthening	I
the	O
first	O
time	O
you	O
ask	O
.	O

Your	O
horse	I
's	O
efforts	O
will	O
improve	O
with	O
repetition	O
.	O

He	O
'll	O
get	O
into	O
it	O
when	O
he	O
feels	O
the	O
freedom	O
you	O
have	O
given	O
him	O
