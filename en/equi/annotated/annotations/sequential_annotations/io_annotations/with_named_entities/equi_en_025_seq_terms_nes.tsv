the	O
process	O
of	O
teaching	O
a	O
horse	I
to	O
piaffe	I

Many	O
horses	I
find	O
piaffe	I
one	O
of	O
the	O
biggest	O
obstacles	O
on	O
the	O
road	O
to	O
Grand	I

Piaffe	I

the	O
trot	I
in	O
place	O
(	O
with	O
a	O
clear	O
diagonal	I
rhythm	I
)	O
,	O
differs	O
from	O
all	O
other	O
dressage	I
movements	I
in	O
that	O
the	O
horse	I
carries	O
more	O
weight	O
with	O
his	O
hind	I
legs	I
(	O
maintaining	O
a	O
fairly	O
strong	O
hock	I
flexion	I
)	O
while	O
providing	O
the	O
upward	O
thrust	I
with	O
his	O
forelegs	I

In	O
all	O
other	O
dressage	I
movements	I
,	O
with	O
the	O
possible	O
exception	O
of	O
the	O
canter	I
pirouette	I
,	O
the	O
horse	I
carries	O
more	O
weight	O
with	O
his	O

while	O
using	O
his	O

for	O
propulsion	O

The	O
ability	O
of	O
a	O
horse	I
to	O
perform	O
a	O
high-quality	O
piaffe	I
is	O
somewhat	O
innate	O
as	O
a	O
result	O
of	O
genetics	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
poor	O
training	I
can	O
easily	O
impair	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
ability	O
to	O
piaffe	I
.	O

Good	O
training	I
is	O
absolutely	O
necessary	O
to	O
develop	O
every	O
horse	I
's	O
potential	O
to	O
piaffe	I
.	O

There	O
are	O
many	O
methods	O
of	O
teaching	O
piaffe	I
.	O

Most	O
horses	I
respond	O
best	O
to	O
a	O
combination	O
of	O
these	O
methods	O
.	O

It	O
's	O
best	O
to	O
introduce	O
piaffe	I
to	O
a	O
horse	I
fairly	O
early	O
in	O
his	O
training	I
.	O

But	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
common	O
mistake	O
to	O
show	I
piaffe	I
before	O
he	O
is	O
ready	O
,	O
causing	O
him	O
to	O
become	O
tense	O
when	O
asked	O
to	O
show	I
piaffe	I
in	O
a	O
test	I
.	O

Often	O
months	O
,	O
and	O
even	O
years	O
,	O
are	O
necessary	O
before	O
a	O
horse	I
clearly	O
understands	O
the	O
rider	I
's	O
aids	I
for	O
piaffe	I
or	O
becomes	O
strong	O
enough	O
physically	O
to	O
execute	O
piaffe	I
without	O
undue	O
stress	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
work	O
with	O
a	O
young	O
horse	I
,	O
I	O
first	O
need	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
decision	O
about	O
whether	O
this	O
horse	I
will	O
be	O
asked	O
to	O
compete	O
at	O
the	O
Grand	I
Prix	I
level	O
.	O

If	O
the	O
answer	O
is	O
yes	O
,	O
I	O
know	O
that	O
I	O
must	O
plan	O
to	O
schedule	O
an	O
extra	O
20	O
minutes	O
about	O
three	O
times	O
a	O
week	O
for	O
piaffe	I
schooling	I
.	O

I	O
usually	O
teach	O
piaffe	I
before	O
passage	I
,	O
although	O
I	O
rarely	O
turn	O
down	O

if	O
a	O

it	O

On	O
the	O

that	O
a	O

I	O

a	O
person	O
stand	O
at	O
the	O

and	O
a	O
whip	I
4.	O
to	O
5	O
feet	O
in	O

I	O
like	O
to	O
use	O
side	I
reins	I
on	O
the	O
horse	I
at	O

to	O
help	O
keep	O
his	O
neck	I

straight	O

.	O

I	O
begin	O
by	O
simply	O
asking	O
the	O
horse	I
to	O
walk	I
forward	I
a	O
few	O
steps	I
followed	O
by	O
a	O
halt	I

A	O
cluck	I
signals	O
the	O
horse	I
to	O

a	O

with	O
a	O
check	O
on	O
the	O

if	O
needed—to	O
halt	I

From	O
time	O
to	O

I	O
give	O
the	O

an	O
easily	O

when	O

I	O
hold	O
the	O
whip	I
in	O
the	O

It	O
is	O
important	O
to	O
stay	O
near	O
the	O

for	O

reasons	O
in	O

Some	O

with	O
two	O

the	O

for	O
five	O

10	O
minutes	O

ahead	O
and	O
allowing	O
me	O
to	O

his	O

He	O

to	O
halt	I
straight	I

Trot–Halt–Trot	I

When	O
the	O
halt–walk	I
exercise	I
is	O
well	O
performed	O

I	O
begin	O
to	O
ask	O
the	O
horse	I
for	O
a	O

differently	O
to	O
the	O

the	O

the	O

Only	O
a	O

to	O
be	O
performed	O
before	O
I	O
ask	O
the	O
horse	I
to	O
halt	I

Then	O
I	O
praise	I
him	O

Short	O
training	I
sessions	O

him	O

his	O
reactions	O

the	O

a	O

it	O

a	O

enough	O
to	O
allow	O
you	O

he	O
may	O
not	O

may	O
profit	O
from	O

Asking	O
the	O

him	O

I	O
might	O
also	O

him	O
on	O

that	O
it	O
takes	O

analysis	O

of	O

keep	O
the	O
horse	I
in	O
the	O

a	O

to	O
maintain	O
active	I

I	O
need	O
to	O

Overengaging	O
the	O

his	O
balance	I
,	O
returning	O
to	O
a	O
correctly	O
balanced	I
position	O
.	O

Maintaining	O
a	O
round	O
topline	I
is	O
also	O
important	O
,	O
although	O
usually	O
when	O
the	O
horse	I
works	O
in-hand	I
and	O
wears	O
side	I
reins	I
,	O
he	O
remains	O
nicely	O
round	O
.	O

Not	O
having	O
to	O
carry	O
the	O
weight	O
of	O
the	O
rider	I
makes	O
the	O
piaffe	I
work	O
much	O
easier	O
for	O
the	O
horse	I
,	O
which	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
benefits	O
of	O
in-hand	I
work	O
.	O

Straightness	I
and	O
regularity	I
are	O
important	O
aspects	O
of	O
schooling	I
piaffe	I
.	O

It	O
may	O
be	O
necessary	O
to	O
shorten	O
the	O
outside	I
side	I
rein	I
to	O
prevent	O
the	O
horse	I
from	O
becoming	O
crooked	I
by	O
falling	I
out	I
on	O
that	O
shoulder	I
.	O

Sometimes	O
during	O
this	O
work	O
,	O
horses	I
will	O
lift	O
one	O
hind	I
leg	I
higher	O
than	O
the	O
other	O
or	O
bring	O
one	O
leg	I
farther	O
forward	O
.	O

Switching	O
directions	O
as	O
necessary	O
when	O
working	O
the	O
horse	I
in-hand	I
usually	O
solves	O
these	O
problems	O
.	O

Gradually	O
,	O
the	O
horse	I
can	O
be	O
asked	O
for	O
shorter	O
steps	I
,	O
although	O
even	O
in	O
Grand	I
Prix	I
competition	I
,	O
moving	O
a	O
hoof	I
's	O
breath	O
forward	O
is	O
allowed	O
.	O

If	O
the	O
horse	I
begins	O
to	O
lose	O
activity	I
,	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
good	O
correction	O
to	O
trot	I
him	O
a	O
few	O
steps	I
forward	I
(	O
but	O
it	O
's	O
challenging	O
to	O
run	O
backward	O
alongside	O
him	O
)	O
.	O

If	O
the	O
horse	I
wants	O
to	O
go	O
too	O
forward	I
,	O
it	O
helps	O
to	O
alternate	O
a	O
few	O
steps	I
back	O
and	O
then	O
go	O
forward	I
again	O
into	O
the	O
half	I
steps	I
.	O

Finally	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
horse	I
performs	O
a	O
reliable	O
,	O
correct	O
piaffe	I
in-hand	I
,	O
a	O
rider	I
can	O
be	O
added	O
.	O

At	O
first	O
,	O
the	O
rider	I
just	O
sits	O
on	O
the	O
horse	I
while	O
the	O
handler	I
continues	O
the	O
work	O
in-hand	I
