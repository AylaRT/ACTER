Classical	I
dressage	I
evolved	O
from	O
cavalry	I
movements	I
and	O
training	I
for	O
the	O
battlefield	O
,	O
and	O
has	O
since	O
developed	O
into	O
the	O
competitive	I

seen	O
today	O

Classical	I
riding	I
is	O
the	O
art	O
of	O
riding	I
in	O
harmony	O
with	O
,	O
rather	O
than	O
against	O
,	O
the	O
horse	I

Correct	O
classical	I
riding	I
only	O
occurs	O
when	O
the	O
rider	I
has	O
a	O
good	O
seat	I
and	O
a	O
correct	O
and	O
well-balanced	I
body	O

moves	O

The	O
origins	O
of	O
classical	I
dressage	I
and	O
collection	I
lie	O
in	O
the	O
natural	O
ability	O
of	O
the	O
horse	I
and	O
its	O
movements	O
in	O
the	O
wild	O
.	O

In	O
fact	O
,	O
most	O
modern	O
definitions	O
of	O
dressage	I
state	O
that	O
the	O
goal	O
is	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
horse	I
perform	O
under	I
saddle	I
with	O
the	O
degree	O
of	O
athleticism	O
and	O
grace	O
that	O
it	O
naturally	O
shows	O
when	O
free	O
.	O

Horses	I
naturally	O
use	O
collection	I
when	O
playing	O
,	O
fighting	O
,	O
competing	O
and	O
courting	O
with	O
each	O
other	O
.	O

When	O
trying	O
to	O
impress	O
other	O
horses	I
,	O
they	O
make	O
themselves	O
look	O
bigger	O
,	O
just	O
as	O
other	O
animals	O
do	O
.	O

They	O
achieve	O
this	O
by	O
lifting	O
the	O
forehand	I
,	O
raising	O
the	O
neck	I
and	O
making	O
it	O
bigger	O
by	O
flexing	O
the	O
poll	I
,	O
while	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
transforming	O
their	O
gaits	I
to	O
emphasize	O
more	O
upwards	I
movement	I
.	O

When	O
fighting	O
,	O
the	O
horse	I
will	O
collect	I
because	O
in	O
collection	I
he	O
can	O
produce	O
lightning	O
speed	O
reactions	O
for	O
kicking	I
,	O
rearing	I
,	O
spinning	O
,	O
striking	O
with	O
the	O
front	I
feet	I
,	O
bucking	I
and	O
jumping	I
.	O

This	O
natural	O
ability	O
to	O
collect	I
is	O
visible	O
in	O
every	O
horse	I
of	O
any	O
breed	I
,	O
and	O
probably	O
inspired	O
early	O
trainers	I
to	O
reproduce	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
behavior	O
in	O
more	O
controlled	O
circumstances	O
.	O

This	O
origin	O
also	O
points	O
out	O
why	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
most	O
Classical	I
dressage	I
trainers	I
,	O
every	O
healthy	O
horse	I
,	O
regardless	O
of	O
its	O
breed	I
,	O
can	O
perform	O
classical	I
dressage	I
movements	I
,	O
including	O
the	O
Haute	I
Ecole	I
jumps	I
,	O
or	O
Airs	I
above	I
the	I
ground	I
,	O
even	O
though	O
it	O
may	O
perform	O
them	O
a	O
little	O
differently	O
from	O
the	O
ideal	O
performance	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
build	O
of	O
its	O
body	O
.	O

The	O
ultimate	O
goal	O
of	O
dressage	I
training	I
is	O
to	O
develop	O
a	O
horse	I
to	O
its	O
ability	O
as	O
an	O
athlete	O
:	O
maximum	O
performance	O
with	O
a	O

training	I
scale	I
(	O
as	O
set	O
for	O
in	O
the	O

is	O
to	O
physically	O
develop	O
the	O
horse	I
in	O
a	O
consistent	O
manner	O
with	O
longevity	O
in	O

Dressage	I
is	O

needs	O

out	O

Along	O
with	O
these	O
developments	O
came	O
an	O
increase	O
in	O
indoor	I

The	O

gave	O
rise	O
to	O
a	O
new	O
and	O
more	O

approach	O
to	O

as	O
a	O

of	O
the	O

of	O

By	O
the	O

had	O

a	O

art	O
,	O
with	O
both	O
rider	I
and	O
horse	I
spending	O
many	O
years	O
perfecting	O
their	O
form	O

Gueriniere	I
,	O
Eisenberg	I
,	O
Ruy	I
d'Andrade	I
and	O
Marialva	I
wrote	O
treatises	O
on	O
technique	O
and	O
theory	O
during	O
these	O
periods	O

The	O
horses	I
were	O
trained	I
to	O
perform	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
airs	I
above	I
the	I
ground	I
(	O

Classical	I
dressage	I
vs.	O
competitive	I
dressage	I

Modern	I
dressage	I
evolved	O
from	O
the	O
classical	O
school	O
,	O
although	O
it	O
now	O
exists	O
in	O
a	O
somewhat	O
different	O
form	O
from	O
its	O
ancestor	O
.	O

Competitive	I
dressage	I
is	O
an	O
international	O
sport	O
ranging	O
from	O
beginner	O
levels	O
to	O
the	O
Olympics	I
.	O

Unlike	O
classical	I
dressage	I
,	O
competitive	I
dressage	I
does	O
not	O
require	O
the	O
airs	I
above	I
ground	I
,	O
which	O
most	O
horses	I
can	O
not	O
perform	O
well	O
even	O
with	O
correct	O
training	I
,	O
due	O
to	O
physical	O
limitations	O
.	O

Instead	O
,	O
competitive	I
dressage	I
focuses	O
on	O
movements	I
such	O
as	O
the	O
piaffe	I
,	O
passage	I
,	O
half-pass	I
,	O
extended	I
trot	I
,	O
pirouette	I
,	O
and	O
tempi	I
changes	I
.	O

In	O
theory	O
,	O
competitive	I
dressage	I
should	O
follow	O
the	O
same	O
principles	O
as	O
classical	I
dressage	I
.	O

However	O
,	O
there	O
has	O
been	O
criticism	O
by	O
some	O
riders	I
for	O
the	O
trend	O
at	O
all	O
levels	O
for	O
quick	O
fixes	O
and	O
incorrect	O
training	I
that	O
makes	O
the	O
horse	I
appear	O
correct	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
is	O
in	O
fact	O
neglecting	O
the	O
fundamentals	O
.	O

Classical	I
riders	I
criticize	O
such	O
training	I
methods	O
on	O
the	O
grounds	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
biomechanically	O
incompatible	O
with	O
correct	O
movement	O
,	O
are	O
painful	O
to	O
the	O
horse	I
,	O
and	O
cause	O
long-term	O
physical	O
damage	O
.	O

These	O
short-cuts	O
usually	O
catch	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
rider	I
as	O
they	O
move	O
up	O
the	O
levels	O
and	O
need	O
to	O
be	O
corrected	O
to	O
perform	O
certain	O
movements	I

While	O
these	O
modern	O
methods	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
the	O
highly	O
controversial	O
rollkur	I
technique	O
,	O
can	O
produce	O
winning	O
animals	O
,	O
classical	I
dressage	I
riders	I
argue	O
that	O
such	O
training	I
is	O
incorrect	O
and	O
even	O
abusive	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
also	O
believed	O
by	O
some	O
that	O
competitive	I
dressage	I
does	O
not	O
always	O
reward	O
the	O
most	O
correctly	O
trained	I
horse	I
and	O
rider	I
,	O
especially	O
at	O
the	O
lower	O
levels	O

For	O
example	O
,	O
some	O
riders	I
who	O
consider	O
themselves	O
to	O
be	O
training	I
classically	O
would	O
not	O
ask	O
their	O
horse	I
to	O
hold	O
his	O
head	I
near-vertical	O
when	O
he	O
first	O
began	O
training	I
,	O
and	O
this	O
would	O
be	O
penalized	O
at	O
the	O
lower	O
levels	O
of	O
competitive	I
dressage	I

marked	O
down	O
because	O
the	O
horse	I
is	O
not	O
considered	O

correctly	O
on	I
the	I

Other	O
riders	I

who	O
also	O
would	O
consider	O
themselves	O
classically	I

would	O
disagree	O

that	O

in	O
a	O

(	O

he	O
is	O

this	O
