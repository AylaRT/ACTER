One	O
of	O
the	O
most	O

as	O

you	O

The	O
Free	I
Walk	I

An	O
ideal	O
free	I
walk	I
is	O
four	O
clear	O
beats	I
,	O
has	O
good	O
energy	O
,	O
overtracks	I
(	O
when	O
the	O
hind	I

the	O
print	O
made	O
by	O
the	O

and	O
the	O
horse	I

neck	O
reaches	O
forward	I
and	O
downward	I
with	O
a	O
round	O
,	O
long	O
topline	I

Horses	I
need	O
plenty	O
of	O
free	I
walk	I
breaks	O
during	O
training	I
to	O
let	O
their	O
muscles	I
relax	I
.	O

Consistency	O
is	O
the	O
most	O
important	O
quality	O
in	O
the	O
training	I
so	O
the	O
standard	O
must	O
not	O
change	O
when	O
you	O
take	O
a	O
walk	I
break	O
.	O

If	O
the	O
free	I
walk	I
has	O
the	O
following	O
elements	O
,	O
your	O
horse	I
will	O
feel	O
good	O
when	O
you	O
shorten	O
the	O
reins	I
and	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
work	O
.	O

During	O
the	O
walk	I
break	O
,	O
ask	O
yourself	O
:	O

•	O
Is	O
my	O
horse	I
in	O
front	O
of	O
my	O
leg	I
?	O

•	O
Is	O
he	O
reaching	O
for	O
the	O
contact	I
?	O

•	O
Is	O
he	O
using	O
his	O
back	I
properly	O
?	O

If	O
not	O
,	O
when	O
you	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
work	O
,	O
your	O
horse	I
might	O
be	O
behind	I
the	I
leg	I
,	O
disconnected	O
and	O
feel	O
tight	O
,	O
hollow	O
or	O
stiff	O
in	O
the	O
back	I
.	O

The	O
rider	I
can	O
not	O
be	O
upset	O
with	O
the	O
horse	I
because	O
she	O
allowed	O
these	O
traits	O
during	O
the	O
break	O
.	O

Besides	O
consistency	O
in	O
the	O
training	I
,	O
riding	I
a	O
good	O
free	I
walk	I
is	O
effective	O
strength-building	O
.	O

Think	O
of	O
the	O
difference	O
for	O
yourself	O
if	O
you	O
do	O
a	O
power	O
walk	I
.	O

You	O
are	O
striding	O
down	O
the	O
road	O
with	O
good	O
posture	O
,	O
with	O
your	O
eyes	I
up	O
and	O
your	O
arms	I
swinging	O

Compare	O
that	O
to	O
strolling	O
along	O
,	O
dragging	O
your	O
feet	I
with	O
your	O
head	I
down	O

Which	O
one	O
is	O
better	O
for	O
your	O
body	O
?	O

For	O
a	O
horse	I
who	O
needs	O
to	O
improve	O
fitness	O
,	O
the	O
walk	I
is	O
the	O
most	O
important	O
thing	O
to	O
focus	O
on	O
.	O

Riding	I
a	O
super	O
free	I
walk—especially	I
if	O
you	O
can	O
do	O
it	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
arena	I
and	O
up	O
and	O
down	O
hills—builds	O
muscle	I
without	O
putting	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
strain	O
on	O

and	O
soft	O

Riding	I
the	O
Walk	I

This	O
energetic	O
walk	I
will	O
move	O
the	O
rider	I
's	O
body	O
a	O
fair	O
amount	O
.	O

When	O
a	O
horse	I
marches	O
in	O
the	O
free	I
walk	I
with	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
energy	O
,	O
overtrack	I
and	O
stretch	I
,	O
he	O
must	O
use	O
his	O
back	I
and	O
neck	I
a	O
lot	O
.	O

The	O
rider	I
must	O
follow	I
to	O
stay	O
with	O
that	O
movement	O
.	O

Moving	O
with	O
the	O
walk	I
means	O
your	O
whole	O
body	O
follows	I
the	O
movement	O
of	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
whole	O
body	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
talk	O
specifically	O
about	O
following	I
,	O
I	O
am	O
referring	O
to	O
the	O
rider	I
's	O
shoulders	I
,	O
elbows	I
,	O
forearms	I
and	O
hands	I
.	O

Most	O
people	O
are	O
aware	O
that	O
their	O
hips	I
must	O
move	O
with	O
the	O
horse	I
so	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
stiffen	O
and	O
therefore	O
tighten	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
back	I
.	O

The	O
hips	I
must	O
follow	I
the	O
exact	O
movement	O
of	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
back	I
.	O

The	O
leg	I
must	O
follow	I
the	O
horse	I
's	O
rib	I
cage	I
precisely	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
often	O
I	O
find	O
people	O
have	O
been	O
told	O
to	O
have	O
quiet	O
hands	I
,	O
and	O
they	O
think	O
that	O
means	O
having	O
hands	I
that	O
are	O
still	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
walk	I
,	O
especially	O
a	O
good	O
quality	O
walk	I
,	O
the	O
horse	I
must	O
oscillate	O
his	O
neck	I
forward	O
and	O
back	O
.	O

If	O
the	O
rider	I
does	O
n't	O
follow	I
this	O
oscillation	O
,	O
then	O
the	O
horse	I
will	O
not	O
feel	O
free	O
to	O
use	O
his	O
topline	I
.	O

Proper	O
following	I
in	O
the	O
walk	I
will	O
teach	O
the	O
horse	I
that	O
he	O
can	O
use	O
his	O
neck	I
and	O
increases	O
the	O
amount	O
he	O
uses	O
his	O
back	I
.	O

He	O
should	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
walk	I
through	O
his	O
whole	O
body	O
.	O

Conversely	O
,	O
a	O
rider	I
who	O
does	O
not	O
follow	I
with	O
the	O
walk	I
makes	O
the	O
horse	I
hold	O
his	O
head	I
and	O
neck	I
still	O
,	O
therefore	O
holding	O
and	O
tightening	O
his	O
back	I
,	O
making	O
the	O
walk	I
smaller	O
or	O
sometimes	O
even	O
compromising	O
the	O
four-beat	I
rhythm	I
of	O
the	O
walk	I
.	O

In	O
the	O
walk	I
,	O
the	O
rider	I
's	O
hands	I
should	O
go	O
forward	O
as	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
ears	I
go	O
forward	O
and	O
down	O
,	O
but	O
only	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
the	O
horse	I
requires	O
to	O
maintain	O
a	O
steady	O
contact	I
.	O

The	O
hands	I
will	O
come	O
back	O
to	O
a	O
neutral	O
position	O
as	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
ears	I
come	O
back	O
and	O
up	O

This	O
is	O
opposite	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
the	O
rider	I
's	O
hips	I
move	O
.	O

The	O
motion	O
is	O
like	O
a	O
rowing	O
machine	O
.	O

The	O
hands	I
go	O
forward	O
as	O
the	O
hips	I
go	O
back	O
then	O
the	O
hands	I
come	O
back	O
as	O
the	O
hips	I
go	O
forward	O
.	O

The	O
rider	I
's	O
pelvis	I
must	O
follow	I
the	O
motion	O
of	O
the	O
horse	I
,	O
but	O
I	O
always	O
urge	O
people	O
not	O
to	O
force	O
this	O
motion	O

Riders	I
should	O
not	O
push	O
or	O
drive	I
with	O
the	O
seat	I
bones	I
in	O
the	O
walk	I

If	O
you	O
try	O
to	O
push	O
and	O
shove	O
with	O
the	O
seat	I
to	O
make	O
a	O
bigger	O
walk	I
,	O
the	O
horse	I
usually	O
drops	O
his	O
back	I
and	O
slows	O
down	O
.	O

Instead	O
,	O
focus	O
on	O
following	I
with	O
the	O
arms	I

and	O
the	O
pelvis	I
will	O
usually	O
move	O
enough	O

As	O

as	O
the	O

stops	O

Find	O
Your	O
Free	I

First	O
,	O
make	O
sure	O
you	O
are	O
following	I
the	I
walk	I

Ask	O
someone	O
to	O
walk	I
along	O
with	O
the	O
horse	I
while	O
you	O
close	O
your	O
eyes	I

Imagine	O
the	O
way	O
it	O
felt	O
to	O
ride	I
a	O
horse	I
for	O
the	O
first	O
time	O

I	O
ask	O
the	O
student	O
to	O
totally	O
relax	I
and	O
let	O
her	O
body	O
feel	O
like	O
a	O
wet	O

Many	O
people	O
will	O
automatically	O
follow	I
quite	O
nicely	O
with	O
the	O
arms	I
the	O
first	O
few	O
times	O
they	O
ever	O
sit	O
on	O
a	O
horse	I
because	O
they	O
have	O

been	O
told	O
to	O

Exaggerate	O
how	O

you	O

Think	O
of	O
an	O
old-time	O
washboard	O
with	O
your	O
thumbs	I
on	O
top	O
or	O
a	O
rowing	O

move	O
your	O

Then	O
tone	O
it	O
down	O
slightly	O

Often	O
,	O
people	O
think	O
they	O
are	O
following	I
much	O
more	O
than	O
they	O
are	O
.	O

A	O
common	O
mistake	O
is	O
a	O
free	I
walk	I
with	O
too	O
little	O
energy	O
.	O

I	O
ask	O
people	O
to	O
give	O
the	O
horse	I
all	O
the	O
rein	I
(	O
assuming	O
it	O
is	O
safe	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
)	O
and	O
ask	O
for	O
more	O
walk	I
until	O
they	O
find	O
how	O
much	O
walk	I
the	O
horse	I
can	O
give	O

This	O
might	O
mean	O
he	O
breaks	O
to	O
the	O
trot	I
for	O
a	O
couple	O
steps	I

No	O
problem	O
!	O

Quietly	O
bring	O
the	O
horse	I
back	O
to	O
walk	I
through	O
the	O
voice	O
and	O
seat	I
and	O
then	O
ask	O
him	O
to	O
walk	I
forward	O
again	O
.	O

I	O
use	O
leg	I

voice	O
and	O
maybe	O
the	O
whip	I
if	O
needed	O
to	O
create	O
more	O
walk	I

Again	O
,	O
do	O
not	O
pump	I
and	O
push	O
with	O
the	O
seat	I
bones	I

The	O
more	O
energy	O
the	O
horse	I
has	O
in	O
walk	I
,	O
the	O
more	O
he	O
will	O
be	O
willing	O
to	O
stretch	I

The	O
more	O
he	O
stretches	I
,	O
the	O
bigger	O
you	O
can	O
get	O
the	O

When	O
the	O
rider	I
can	O
stay	O
connected	I
to	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
mouth	I
this	O
way	O
,	O
with	O
an	O
elastic	O
contact	I

he	O
is	O
then	O
ready	O
to	O
use	O
that	O
contact	I
to	O
influence	O
his	O
horse	I
.	O

Just	O
as	O
a	O
young	O
horse	I
must	O
learn	O
to	O
simply	O
accept	O
contact	I
before	O
he	O
learns	O
to	O
yield	I
to	O
it	O
,	O
a	O
rider	I
must	O
first	O
learn	O
to	O
simply	O
find	O
the	O
contact	I
at	O
all	O
times	O
before	O
she	O
can	O
affect	O
the	O
horse	I
through	O
the	O
contact	I

If	O
the	O
rider	I
learns	O
to	O
ride	I
with	O
hands	I
that	O
correctly	O
follow	I
the	O
horse	I
,	O
the	O
horse	I
will	O
become	O
more	O
sensitive	O
to	O
her	O
requests	O
.	O

For	O
example	O
,	O
a	O
horse	I
who	O
expects	O
a	O
following	I
hand	I
will	O
be	O
very	O
sensitive	O
to	O
the	O
moment	O
when	O
the	O
hand	I
stops	O
following	I
to	O
give	O
a	O
half	I
halt	I
that	O
shifts	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
balance	I
.	O

One	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
basic	O
half	I
halts	I
is	O
to	O
go	O
from	O
free	I
walk	I
on	O
a	O
long	I
rein	I
to	O
a	O
medium	I
walk	I
,	O
where	O
we	O
ask	O
the	O
horse	I
to	O
close	I
the	I
frame	I
and	O
come	O
a	O
bit	O
more	O
onto	O
the	O
haunches	I
in	O
preparation	O
for	O
a	O
transition	I
.	O

This	O
transition	I
from	O
free	I
walk	I
to	O
medium	I
walk	I
is	O
a	O
hard	O
one	O
for	O
many	O
horses—they	I
either	O
anticipate	O
an	O
upcoming	O
transition	I
to	O
trot	I
or	O
canter	I
and	O
get	O
tight	O
in	O
the	O
back	I
or	O
they	O
lose	O
energy	O
and	O
get	O
stiff	O
through	O
the	O
topline	I
.	O

As	O
the	O
rider	I
shortens	O
the	O
reins	I
for	O
medium	I
walk	I
,	O
the	O
driving	I
leg	I
is	O
ready	O
to	O
ask	O
the	O
horse	I
to	O
keep	O
the	O
energy	O
and	O
march	O
he	O
had	O
in	O
the	O
free	I
walk	I
.	O

Then	O
the	O
core	I
of	O
the	O
rider	I
engages	O
and	O
the	O
hands	I
close	O
around	O
the	O
reins	I
to	O
rebalance	I
the	O
horse	I
or	O
shift	O
the	O
weight	O
slightly	O
to	O
the	O
hindquarters	I
.	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
moment	O
when	O
the	O
rider	I
's	O
hand	I
does	O
not	O
follow	I
because	O
we	O
are	O
telling	O
the	O
horse	I
to	O
shorten	O
himself	O
from	O
back	O
to	O
front	O
and	O
stay	O
more	O
uphill	I
,	O
rather	O
than	O
allowing	O
him	O
to	O
lean	O
down	O
and	O
forward	O
into	I
the	I
contact	I
.	O

Once	O
the	O
half	I
halt	I
goes	O
through	O
the	O
horse	I

body	O
and	O
he	O
responds	O
by	O
shifting	O

the	O
