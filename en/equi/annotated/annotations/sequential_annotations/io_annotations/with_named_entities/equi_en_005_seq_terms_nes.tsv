Piaffe	I

The	O
piaffe	I
is	O
a	O
dressage	I
movement	I
where	O
the	O
horse	I
is	O
in	O
a	O
highly	O
collected	I
and	O
cadenced	I
trot	I
,	O
in	O
place	O
or	O
nearly	O
in	O
place	O
.	O

The	O
center	O
of	O
gravity	O
of	O
the	O
horse	I
should	O
be	O
more	O
towards	O
the	O
hind	I
end	I
,	O
with	O
the	O
hindquarters	I
slightly	O
lowered	O
and	O
great	O
bending	I
of	O
the	O
joints	I
in	O
the	O
hind	I
legs	I
.	O

The	O
front	I
end	I
of	O
the	O
horse	I
is	O
highly	O
mobile	O
,	O
free	O
,	O
and	O
light	O
,	O
with	O
great	O
flexion	I
in	O
the	O
joints	I
of	O
the	O
front	I
legs	I
,	O
and	O
the	O
horse	I
remains	O
light	I
in	I
the	I
hand	I
.	O

The	O
horse	I
should	O
retain	O
a	O
clear	O
and	O
even	O
rhythm	I
,	O
show	O
great	O
impulsion	I
,	O
and	O
ideally	O
should	O
have	O
a	O
moment	I
of	I
suspension	I
between	O
the	O
foot	I
falls	I
.	O

As	O
in	O
all	O
dressage	I
,	O
the	O
horse	I
should	O
perform	O
in	O
a	O
calm	O
manner	O
and	O
remain	O
on	I
the	I
bit	I
with	O
a	O
round	I
back	I
.	O

The	O
piaffe	I
was	O
originally	O
used	O
in	O
battle	O
to	O
keep	O
the	O
horse	I
focused	O
,	O
warm	O
,	O
and	O
moving	O
,	O
ready	O
to	O
move	O
forward	O
into	O
battle	O
.	O

In	O
modern	O
times	O
,	O
the	O
piaffe	I
is	O
mostly	O
taught	O
as	O
an	O
upper	O
level	O
movement	I
in	O
Classical	I
dressage	I
and	O
as	O
a	O
Grand	I
Prix	I
level	I
movement	I
.	O

Additionally	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
needed	O
to	O
develop	O
the	O
levade	I
and	O
from	O
that	O
,	O
the	O
airs	I
above	I
the	I
ground	I
.	O

Correct	O
piaffe	I
work	O

The	O
following	O
are	O
elements	O
of	O
the	O
correct	O
piaffe	I
:	O

The	O
piaffe	I
is	O
straight	O
and	O
comes	O
from	O
the	O
rider	I
containing	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
desire	O
to	O
go	O
forward	I
.	O

The	O
legs	I
do	O
not	O
move	O
out	O
to	O
the	O
side	O
or	O
cross	O
.	O

The	O
horse	I
lowers	O
his	O
hindquarters	I
,	O
collects	I
,	O
and	O
raises	O
the	O
shoulders	I
by	O
taking	O
weight	O
onto	O
the	O
hindquarters	I
,	O
rather	O
than	O
hollowing	O
the	O
back	I
and	O
piaffing	I
with	O
the	O
hindquarters	I
trailing	O
out	O
behind	O
.	O

Bending	I
of	O
the	O
joints	I
is	O
not	O
always	O
a	O
good	O
indication	O
of	O
true	O
collection	I
(	O
and	O
therefore	O
a	O
correct	O
piaffe	I
)	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
possible	O
to	O
perform	O
a	O
piaffe-like	I
movement	I
with	O
good	O
bend	I
in	O
the	O
legs	I
while	O
the	O
horse	I
remains	O
hollow	O
and	O
on	I
the	I
forehand	I
.	O

This	O
can	O
especially	O
be	O
seen	O
in	O
horses	I
trained	I
to	O
trot	I
in	O
place	O
by	O
holding	O
them	O
back	O
while	O
asking	O
the	O
hindlegs	I
to	O
bend	I
by	O
applying	O
the	O
whip	I
on	O
the	O
hocks	I
.	O

The	O
horse	I
will	O
bend	I
the	O
hocks	I
,	O
but	O
will	O
not	O
lower	O
the	O
hindquarters	I
.	O

The	O
horse	I
is	O
not	O
to	O
raise	O
the	O
hind	I
legs	I
higher	O
than	O
the	O
front	O
,	O
which	O
comes	O
when	O
the	O
horse	I
is	O
on	I
the	I
forehand	I
,	O
nor	O
show	O
exaggerated	O
bending	I
of	O
the	O
front	I
legs	I
without	O
true	O
collection	I
.	O

The	O
horse	I
remains	O
relaxed	I
and	O
supple	I
.	O

An	O
incorrect	O
piaffe	I
has	O
short	O
,	O
jerky	O
steps	I
.	O

The	O
horse	I
does	O
not	O
move	O
his	O
fore	I
legs	I
backwards	O
toward	O
his	O
hind	I
legs	I
,	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
more	O
under	O
his	O
body	O
,	O
but	O
rather	O
keep	O
them	O
perpendicular	O
to	O
the	O
ground	O
.	O

The	O
horse	I
remains	O
at	O
or	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
the	O
vertical	O
,	O
with	O
his	O
poll	I
as	O
the	O
highest	O
point	O

The	O
horse	I
maintains	O
the	O
rhythm	I
and	O
tempo	I
of	O
the	O
