The	O

that	O
special	O

the	O

result	O
of	O
forward	I
half	I

It	O
's	O
simple	O
in	O
theory	O
and	O
not	O
difficult	O
in	O
practice	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
rider	I
needs	O
to	O
be	O
persistent	O
and	O
open	O
to	O
thinking	O
in	O
a	O
counterintuitive	O
way	O
.	O

Here	O
's	O
how	O
:	O

Normally	O
,	O
when	O
riders	I
think	O
of	O
downward	I
transitions	I
and	O
half	I
halts	I
,	O
they	O
think	O
of	O
coming	O
back	O
from	O
something	O
more	O
to	O
something	O
less	O
.	O

They	O
might	O
go	O
from	O
a	O
lengthened	I
stride	I
and	O
half	I
halt	I
back	O
to	O
a	O
working	I
trot	I
.	O

They	O
might	O
do	O
downward	I
transitions	I
from	O
canter	I
(	O
12	O
mph	O
)	O
to	O
trot	I
(	O
8	O
mph	O
)	O
or	O
from	O
trot	I
to	O
walk	I
(	O
4	O
mph	O
)	O
.	O

The	O
frequent	O
scenario	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
rider	I
thinks	O
of	O
coming	O
back	O
to	O
walk	I
from	O
trot	I
.	O

She	O
puts	O
the	O

on	O
with	O

Then	O
,	O
with	O
another	O
combination	O
of	O

the	O
rider	I
says	O

Walk	I

Those	O
half	I
halts	I
work	O
in	O
a	O
rudimentary	O
way	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
tell	O
the	O
horse	I
what	O
not	O
to	O
do	O
rather	O
than	O
what	O
to	O
do	O

Forward	I

tell	O
your	O

what	O
to	O

Can	O
you	O
,	O
instead	O
of	O
thinking	O
of	O
coming	O
back	O
to	O
the	O

your	O

with	O
your	O

That	O
will	O
have	O
the	O
effect	O

closing	O
the	O
horse	I
from	O

the	O

Your	O
hands	I
say	O

Cover	O

ground	O
,	O
and	O
because	O
your	O
horse	I
's	O
strides	I
are	O
smaller	O

they	O
will	O
be	O
higher	O
and	O

Finally	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
trot	I
strides	I
get	O
smaller	O
,	O
your	O
miles	O

hour	O
will	O
decrease	O
until	O
you	O
're	O
trotting	I
at	O
4	O

the	O
speed	O
of	O

At	O
this	O
point	O
your	O
horse	I
will	O
ask	O
you	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
him	O
to	O
walk	I

Say	O
Yes	O

Or	O
,	O
alternatively	O
,	O
you	O
can	O
go	O
back	O

an	O
8-mph	O

Does	O
this	O
sound	O
like	O
collection	I
?	O

Yes	O

You	O
can	O
dance	O
your	O
way	O
between	O
trot	I
and	O
walk	I
or	O
between	O
canter	I
and	O
trot	I

Note	O
that	O
the	O
half	I

walk	I
and	O
canter	I
is	O
slightly	O
different	O
from	O
the	O
half	I

There	O
is	O
a	O
forward	I
moment	O
of	O
the	O
walk	I

canter	I
strides	I
in	O
which	O
the	O
horse	I
reaches	O
with	O
his	O
head	I

The	O

arms	I

In	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
half	I

the	O

the	O

her	O

In	O
the	O

the	O
head	I

the	O
rider	I

so	O
the	O
rider	I
closes	O
her	O
fingers	I
to	O

It	O
's	O
important	O
that	O
the	O

When	O

at	O
4	O

then	O
you	O

Very	O

and	O
forget	O
the	O
leg	I

When	O

ridden	I
backward	O

the	O

and	O
the	O
horse	I

lost	O

Backward	O
half	I

physical	O
tightness	O
in	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
back	I
,	O
neck	I
and	O
jaw	I
,	O
which	O
shuts	O
down	O
the	O
hindquarters	I
.	O

Mentally	O
,	O
the	O
horse	I
feels	O
restricted	O
.	O

The	O
rein	I
aid	I
should	O
always	O
be	O
combined	O
with	O
and	O
should	O
be	O
less	O
than	O
the	O
seat	I
and	O
leg	I
aids	I
.	O

The	O
seat	I
and	O

drive	I
the	O
hindquarters	I
into	O
the	O
fixed	O
(	O
not	O
pulling	O
)	O
hand	I
.	O

These	O
aids	I
should	O
bring	O
the	O
hind	I
legs	I
under	O
the	O
horse	I
toward	O
his	O
center	O
of	O
gravity	O
so	O
he	O
closes	O
the	O
frame	I
from	O
behind	O
,	O
putting	O
him	O
in	O
better	O
balance	I

The	O
half	I

reduces	O
ground	O

without	O
stopping	O
the	O
circle	O
of	O

or	O

the	O
horse	I

He	O
remains	O
relaxed	I

in	O
the	O
body	O
and	O
does	O
not	O
feel	O
restricted	O
during	O
the	O

If	O
the	O

out	O

,	O
she	O
can	O
not	O
ride	I
from	O
back	O

The	O
most	O
common	O
problem	O
is	O
the	O
rider	I
who	O
leans	O
back	O
and	O
does	O
n't	O
go	O
with	O
the	O
forward	I
motion	I
of	O
the	O
horse	I
during	O
the	O
half	I
halt	I

Thrust	I
from	O
the	O
horse	I
sometimes	O
puts	O
the	O
rider	I
behind	O
the	O
motion	O
.	O

That	O
's	O
just	O
physics	O
at	O
work	O
.	O

Then	O
the	O
rider	I
restricts	O
the	O
horse	I
by	O
sitting	I
against	O
the	O
rein	I
with	O
her	O
shoulders	I
instead	O
of	O
her	O
seat	I
.	O

If	O
the	O
rider	I
's	O
leg	I
goes	O
too	O
far	O
forward	O
,	O
then	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
supporting	O
her	O
weight	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
out	O
of	O
position	O
to	O
help	O
the	O
horse	I
engage	I

This	O
is	O
a	O
form	O
of	O
release	O
that	O
will	O
make	O
your	O
horse	I
comfortable	O
.	O

Why	O
?	O

First	O
,	O
it	O
assures	O
that	O
you	O
are	O
n't	O
providing	O
a	O
fifth	O
leg	I
to	O
help	O
carry	O
your	O
horse	I

Many	O
riders	I
are	O
n't	O
aware	O
that	O
they	O
're	O
providing	O
more	O
support	O
than	O
they	O
ideally	O
should	O
.	O

If	O
your	O
horse	I
lowers	O
his	O
neck	I
during	O
this	O
release	O
,	O
it	O
means	O
that	O
you	O
've	O
unwittingly	O
been	O
carrying	O
it	O
.	O

That	O
small	O
release	O
allows	O
self-carriage	I
,	O
and	O
the	O
neck	I
will	O
go	O
to	O
whatever	O
height	O
it	O
is	O
earning	O
relative	O
to	O
the	O
engagement	I
of	O
the	O
hind	I
legs	I
.	O

Second	O
,	O
it	O
assures	O
that	O
the	O
energy	O
is	O
going	O
from	O
back	O
to	O
front	O
.	O

If	O
it	O
's	O
hard	O
to	O
touch	O
the	O
withers	I
,	O
it	O
means	O
that	O
the	O
energy	O
has	O
been	O
going	O
from	O
front	O
to	O
back	O
.	O

If	O
it	O
is	O
hard	O
for	O
you	O
to	O
release	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
because	O
you	O
've	O

against	O
the	O

this	O

going	O
the	O

at	O
the	O

for	O
walk	I

The	O

If	O
the	O

your	O
