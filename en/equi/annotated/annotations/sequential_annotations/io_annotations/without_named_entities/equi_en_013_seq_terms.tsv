the	O
three-part	O
ride	I
structure—warm-up	I
,	O
work	I
sets	I
and	O
cool-down—we	I
ensure	O
the	O
horse	I
works	O
in	O
optimal	O
physical	O
comfort	O
and	O
emotional	O
health	O
.	O

Our	O
responsibility	O
as	O
riders	I
is	O
to	O
keep	O
the	O
horse	I
happy	O
and	O
healthy	O
in	O
his	O
work	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
ways	O
to	O
do	O
this	O
is	O
to	O
keep	O
the	O
horse	I
comfortable	O
in	O
his	O
body	O
during	O
our	O
rides	I
.	O

When	O
the	O
work	O
feels	O
good	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
he	O
may	O
even	O
offer	O
to	O
do	O
more	O

Without	O
thoughtful	O
planning	O
,	O
you	O
may	O
experience	O
some	O
avoidable	O
problems	O
.	O

For	O
example	O
,	O
if	O
the	O
horse	I
is	O
n't	O
warmed	O
up	O
properly	O
,	O
then	O
the	O
work	O
can	O
be	O
painful	O
for	O
him	O
or	O
cause	O
injury	O
.	O

If	O
work	I
sets	I
are	O
n't	O
planned	O
,	O
then	O
riders	I
may	O
repeat	O
the	O
same	O
movement	I
too	O
many	O
times	O
or	O
too	O
many	O
days	O
in	O
a	O
row	O
and	O
cause	O
repetitive-motion	O
injuries	O
or	O
unintentionally	O
demoralize	O
the	O
horse	I
.	O

If	O
the	O
horse	I
is	O
n't	O
cooled	O
down	O
and	O
stretched	I
out	O
properly	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
a	O
ride	I
,	O
then	O
a	O
pattern	O
of	O
tightness	O
is	O
established	O
that	O
makes	O
each	O
day	O
's	O
work	O
a	O
chore	O

Follow	O
these	O
guidelines	O
to	O
plan	O
your	O

Ride	I
Structure	O
101	O

The	O
basic	O
structure	O
of	O
a	O
training	I
ride	I
for	O
every	O
horse	I
should	O
always	O
be	O
the	O
same	O
:	O
warm-up	I
,	O
work	I
sets	I
and	O
cool-down	I
.	O

There	O
is	O
much	O
room	O
for	O
variation	O
within	O
each	O
of	O
the	O
three	O
phases	O
for	O
each	O
individual	O
horse	I
.	O

The	O
amount	O
of	O
time	O
you	O
spend	O
in	O
each	O
phase	O
and	O
the	O
goal	O
of	O
each	O
phase	O
will	O
also	O
vary	O
from	O
day	O
to	O
day	O
.	O

Warm-Up	I

A	O
correct	O
warm-up	I
prepares	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
joints	I
and	O
muscles	I
for	O
the	O
demands	O
of	O
the	O
work	I
sets	I
.	O

The	O
initial	O
10	O
minutes	O
of	O
a	O
ride	I
should	O
be	O
an	O
active	I
walk	I
on	O
long	I
reins	I
.	O

As	O
the	O
horse	I
walks	I
,	O
the	O
joint	I
fluid	O
circulates	O
and	O
lubricates	O
the	O
joints	I
.	O

Then	O
the	O
rider	I
should	O
establish	O
a	O
basic	O
connection	I
and	O
ride	I
five	O
to	O
10	O
minutes	O
of	O
working	I
trot	I
and	O
canter	I
on	O
20-meter	I
circles	I
,	O
straight	O
lines	O
,	O
bending	I
lines	O
and	O
changes	O
of	O
direction	O
.	O

This	O
pumps	O
oxygenated	O
blood	O
throughout	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
muscles	I
so	O
that	O
the	O
muscle	I
fibers	O
become	O
warm	O
and	O
pliable	O
.	O

During	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
this	O
phase	O
,	O
the	O
horse	I
may	O
be	O
ready	O
for	O
more	O
suppling	I
work	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
leg	I
yields	I
and	O
15-meter	I
circles	I
.	O

By	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
warm-up	I
the	O
horse	I
should	O
be	O
confirmed	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
three	O
steps	O
of	O
the	O
Training	I
Scale—he	I
should	O
demonstrate	O
rhythmic	I
gaits	I
,	O
feel	O
supple	I
in	O
his	O
body	O
and	O
achieve	O
the	O
connection	I
required	O
for	O
the	O
work	O
ahead	O
.	O

Note	O
that	O
certain	O
types	O
of	O
horses	I
require	O
you	O
to	O
spend	O
more	O
time	O
in	O
the	O
warm-up	I
phase	O
.	O

For	O
example	O
,	O
horses	I
who	O
are	O
older	O
,	O
stiffer	O
or	O
have	O
had	O
time	O
off	O
take	O
longer	O
to	O
achieve	O
suppleness	I
.	O

Take	O
the	O
time	O
you	O
need	O
.	O

Especially	O
if	O
the	O
horse	I
is	O
coming	O
back	O
from	O
an	O
injury—patiently	O
warm	O
up	O
until	O
the	O
joints	I
,	O
ligaments	O
,	O
tendons	O
and	O
muscles	I
are	O
supple	I
.	O

Then	O
the	O
horse	I
has	O
the	O
optimal	O
chance	O
to	O
come	O
back	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
no	O
further	O
injury	O
.	O

The	O
warm-up	I
varies	O
from	O
horse	I
to	O
horse	I
.	O

Some	O
horses	I
loosen	O
up	O
better	O
in	O
the	O
canter	I
while	O
others	O
work	O
better	O
in	O
trot	I
early	O
on	O
.	O

Some	O
horses	I
may	O
need	O
more	O
bending	I
lines	O
to	O
control	O
the	O
tempo	I
while	O
others	O
need	O
more	O
straight	O
lines	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
engine	O
revving	O
.	O

Some	O
horses	I
may	O
take	O
up	O
to	O
30	O
minutes	O
to	O
feel	O
warmed	O
up	O
while	O
others	O
may	O
be	O
ready	O
to	O
work	O
after	O
15	O
minutes	O
.	O

Each	O
rider	I
needs	O
to	O
figure	O
out	O
the	O
best	O
warm-up	I
routine	O
for	O
her	O
individual	O
horse	I
,	O
but	O
the	O
result	O
should	O
be	O
the	O
same	O
:	O
The	O
horse	I
and	O
rider	I
achieve	O
the	O
bottom	O
three	O
rungs	O

Work	I
Sessions	I

Once	O
the	O
horse	I
is	O
properly	O
warmed	O
up	O
,	O
the	O
rider	I
should	O
have	O
a	O
clear	O
plan	O
for	O
what	O
to	O
work	O
on	O
that	O
day	O
.	O

She	O
should	O
ride	I
approximately	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
sets	O
of	O
work	O
with	O
walk	I
breaks	O
in	O
between	O
each	O
set	O
.	O

Build	O
your	O
work	I
sets	I
in	O
a	O
systematic	O
way	O
to	O
set	O
the	O
horse	I
up	O
for	O
success	O
.	O

I	O
like	O
to	O
vary	O
the	O
work	I
sets	I
according	O
to	O
muscle	I
groups	O
.	O

For	O
example	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
worked	O
on	O
canter–walk–canter	I
transitions	I
during	O
one	O
session	O
,	O
then	O
the	O
next	O
session	O
I	O
'll	O
focus	O
on	O
exercises	I
that	O
are	O
less	O
weight-bearing	I
,	O
such	O
as	O
lateral	I
work	I
at	O
the	O
trot	I
.	O

This	O
routine	O
keeps	O
the	O
horse	I
physically	O
comfortable	O
and	O
mentally	O
engaged	I
.	O

Variety	O
in	O
work	O
.	O

The	O
goal	O
of	O
your	O
work	O
will	O
vary	O
from	O
day	O
to	O
day	O
.	O

I	O
plan	O
my	O
rides	I
depending	O
on	O
the	O
day	O
of	O
the	O
week	O
.	O

For	O
instance	O
,	O
my	O
horses	I
work	O
Monday	O
through	O
Friday	O
with	O
the	O
weekends	O
off	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
begin	O
on	O
Monday	O
,	O
I	O
do	O
what	O
I	O
call	O
gaits	I
day	O
.	O

After	O
a	O
slow	O
warm-up	I
,	O
the	O
work	O
phase	O
is	O
focused	O
on	O
the	O
basic	O
gaits	I
with	O
many	O
transitions	I
between	O
and	O
within	O
the	O
gaits	I
.	O

This	O
gives	O
the	O
horse	I
a	O
chance	O
to	O
limber	O
up	O
through	O
his	O
whole	O
musculature	I
system	O

The	O
horse	I
becomes	O
more	O

for	O
more	O
serious	O
work	I

the	O
next	O

I	O

The	O
weekly	O
work	O
schedule	O
varies	O
from	O
horse	I
to	O
horse	I

A	O
lazier	O
horse	I
might	O
do	O
better	O
with	O
two	O
days	O
of	O
working	O
outside	O
of	O
the	O
ring	I
to	O
keep	O
him	O
fresh	O
and	O
increase	O
fitness	O

A	O
horse	I
who	O
has	O
contact	I
issues	O
may	O
benefit	O
from	O
long-lining	I
or	O
longeing	I
during	O
the	O
week	O

A	O
horse	I
who	O
requires	O
fitness	O
can	O
benefit	O
from	O
cavaletti	I

Some	O
horses	I
benefit	O
most	O
from	O
anaerobic	O
work	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
walk	I
lateral	I
work	I
,	O
while	O
others	O
flourish	O

Develop	O
a	O

Cool	I
Out	I

After	O
the	O
work	I
sets	I
,	O
you	O
enter	O
the	O
cool-down	I
session	O
of	O
the	O
ride	I

The	O
rider	I
should	O
stretch	I
her	O
horse	I
in	O
the	O
walk	I
,	O
trot	I
and	O
/	O
or	O
canter	I
.	O

A	O
horse	I
who	O
is	O
still	O
developing	O
strength	O
might	O
do	O
better	O
with	O
a	O
short-duration	O
stretch	I
in	O
the	O
trot	I
so	O
his	O
balance	I
is	O

thrown	O
onto	O
the	O

For	O
this	O
horse	I
,	O
more	O
time	O
is	O
spent	O
stretching	I
in	O
the	O
free	I
walk	I

A	O
fully	O
mature	O
horse	I
can	O
benefit	O
from	O
a	O
longer	O
period	O
of	O
stretch	I
in	O
the	O
trot	I
and	O
canter	I
.	O

Make	O
sure	O
that	O
connection	I
is	O
always	O
maintained	O
in	O
the	O
stretch	I
,	O
which	O
means	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
abdominals	O
are	O
still	O
engaged	I
and	O
the	O
back	I
muscles	I
are	O
lifted	O
.	O

The	O
stretching	I
frame	I
allows	O
the	O
muscles	I
that	O
have	O
been	O
contracted	O
in	O
the	O
work	I
sets	I
to	O
lengthen	O
and	O
dispel	O
the	O
lactic	O
acid	O
that	O
has	O
built	O
up	O
during	O
the	O
session	O
.	O

Finally	O
,	O
the	O
horse	I
should	O
walk	I
on	O
a	O
long	I
rein	I
for	O
five	O
to	O
10	O
minutes	O
or	O
until	O
his	O
muscles	I
return	O
to	O
a	O
comfortable	O
resting	O
body	O
temperature	O

A	O
correct	O
cool-down	I
allows	O
the	O
horse	I
to	O
finish	O
the	O

in	O
the	O
optimal	O
physical	O
and	O
mental	O
state	O
to	O
begin	O

This	O

important	O
every	O

Often	O

your	O

the	O
