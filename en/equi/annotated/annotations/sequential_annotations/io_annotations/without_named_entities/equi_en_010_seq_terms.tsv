How	O
to	O
teach	O
your	O
horse	I
the	O
complex	O
canter	I
pirouette	I
from	O
the	O
walk	I

In	O
the	O
summer	O
of	O
2012	O
,	O
Beth	O
Baumert	O
visited	O
Sarah	O
and	O
Morten	O
Thomsen	O
in	O
Silkeborg	O
,	O
Denmark	O
.	O

Their	O
fantastic	O
brick	O
facility	O
sported	O
natural	O
light	O
and	O
an	O
aviary	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
lovely	O
horses	I
acted	O
like	O
they	O
were	O
special	O
enough	O
to	O
belong	O
there	O
,	O
she	O
reported	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
horse	I
I	O
saw	O
was	O
ridden	I
well	O
,	O
but	O
when	O
I	O
saw	O
him	O
do	O
a	O
canter	I
pirouette	I
,	O
I	O
thought	O
,	O
Wow	O
!	O

That	O
horse	I
can	O
really	O
canter	I
pirouette	I
.	O

Then	O
I	O
saw	O
the	O
next	O
horse	I
and	O
he	O
also	O
had	O
a	O
rare	O
talent	O
for	O
canter	I
pirouette	I
.	O

Then	O
,	O
after	O
the	O
third	O
pirouetting	I
genius	O
,	O
I	O
knew	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
Morten	O
Thomsen	O
who	O
was	O
the	O
genius	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
ask	O
him	O
:	O
How	O
do	O
you	O
do	O
that	O
?	O

Here	O
's	O
what	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
:	O

Trainers	I
often	O
introduce	O
canter	I
pirouettes	I
by	O
spiraling	O
in	O
from	O
a	O
large	I
circle	I
.	O

It	O
's	O
a	O
common	O
mistake	O
,	O
in	O
my	O
opinion	O
,	O
because	O
horses	I
started	O
this	O
way	O
do	O
n't	O
really	O
know	O
what	O
you	O
want	O
.	O

Often	O
the	O
rider	I
starts	O
to	O
kick	I
and	O
pull	O
and	O
the	O
horse	I
does	O
n't	O
understand	O
.	O

The	O
horse	I
gets	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
pressure	O
but	O
he	O
does	O
n't	O
see	O
the	O
purpose	O
.	O

I	O
begin	O
thinking	O
about	O
training	I
canter	I
pirouettes	I
when	O
my	O
horse	I
can	O
do	O
a	O
walk-canter	I
transition	I
with	O
ease	O
.	O

At	O
that	O
point	O
,	O
I	O
know	O
he	O
's	O
ready	O
for	O
a	O
little	O
collection	I
in	O
the	O
canter	I
because	O
he	O
is	O
able	O
to	O
bend	I
his	O
hind	I
legs	I
,	O
lower	O
the	O
quarters	I
and	O
sit	I
.	O

I	O
first	O
ask	O
for	O
collection	I
on	O
a	O
large	I
circle	I
,	O
and	O
the	O
moment	O
that	O
he	O
sits	I
a	O
little	O
,	O
I	O
walk	I
.	O

You	O
can	O
feel	O
when	O
the	O
horse	I
sits	I
because	O
his	O
rhythm	I
slows	O
.	O

This	O
teaches	O
the	O
horse	I
that	O
if	O
he	O
sits	I
,	O
he	O
will	O
get	O
the	O
reward	I
of	O
walking	I
.	O

As	O
a	O
result	O
,	O
he	O
will	O
try	O
to	O
sit	I
quickly	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
be	O
rewarded	I
.	O

Of	O
course	O
,	O
the	O
situation	O
can	O
happen	O
that	O
we	O
go	O
on	O
a	O
circle	I
and	O
I	O
feel	O
that	O
I	O
ca	O
n't	O
get	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
hind	I
legs	I
to	O
bend	I
.	O

Sometimes	O
horses	I
just	O
thrust	I
themselves	O
forward	I
with	O
the	O
hind	I
legs	I
.	O

In	O
this	O
situation	O
,	O
it	O
's	O
impossible	O
for	O
the	O
horse	I
to	O
sit	I
,	O
so	O
I	O
start	O
in	O
walk	I
.	O

In	O
any	O
case	O
,	O
it	O
's	O
easiest	O
for	O
the	O
horse	I
to	O
learn	O
and	O
understand	O
the	O
fundamentals	O
of	O
pirouette	I
in	O
walk	I
,	O
and	O
then	O
the	O
basics	O
are	O
the	O
same	O
for	O
canter	I
.	O

When	O
I	O
can	O
make	O
a	O
large	O
pirouette	I
in	O
walk	I
,	O
my	O
horse	I
will	O
close	O
his	O
frame	I
and	O
sit	I
.	O

It	O
's	O
difficult	O
to	O
sit	I
in	O
canter	I
,	O
but	O
in	O
walk	I
,	O
the	O
horse	I
will	O
achieve	O
it	O
from	O
the	O
work	O
you	O
've	O
done	O
.	O

At	O
this	O
point	O
,	O
my	O
horse	I
already	O
knows	O
everything	O
he	O
needs	O
to	O
learn	O
about	O
canter	I
pirouette	I
.	O

I	O
teach	O
my	O
horse	I
all	O
these	O
things	O
before	O
we	O
start	O
it	O
in	O
canter	I
.	O

First	O
Master	O
the	O
Walk	I
Pirouette	I

I	O
begin	O
by	O
teaching	O
my	O
horse	I
to	O
do	O
travers	I
,	O
or	O
haunches-in	I
,	O
on	O
a	O
circle	I
.	O

Then	O
,	O
I	O
ask	O
him	O
to	O
turn	O
in	O
the	O
travers	I
to	O
make	O
a	O
pirouette	I
in	O
walk	I
.	O

Here	O
's	O
how	O
I	O
begin	O
:	O
I	O
control	O
my	O
horse	I
's	O
shoulders	I
with	O
the	O
position	O
of	O
my	O
hands	I
.	O

If	O
I	O
want	O
the	O
shoulders	I
to	O
move	O
left	O
,	O
I	O
take	O
both	O
hands	I
to	O
the	O
left	O
.	O

If	O
I	O
want	O
them	O
to	O
go	O
right	O
I	O
take	O
both	O
hands	I
right	O
.	O

It	O
's	O
similar	O
to	O
western	I
neck	I
reining	I
.	O

By	O
making	O
my	O
horse	I
's	O
shoulders	I
mobile	O
,	O
my	O
goal	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
center	O
those	O
shoulders	I
exactly	O
over	O
the	O
inside	I
hind	I
leg	I
,	O
and	O
that	O
inside	I
hind	O
must	O
keep	O
stepping	I
forward	I
rather	O
than	O
going	O
to	O
the	O
side	O
.	O

In	O
pirouette	I
left	I
,	O
for	O
example	O
,	O
I	O
want	O
my	O
horse	I
to	O
bend	I
left	O
and	O
turn	O
left	O
.	O

If	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
pirouette	I
bigger	O
,	O
I	O
move	O
the	O
shoulders	I
out	O
with	O
my	O
inside	I
(	O
left	O
)	O
rein	I
.	O

Then	O
I	O
turn	O
from	O
the	O
outside	I
(	O
right	O
)	O
leg	I
and	O
rein	I
,	O
but	O
mostly	O
the	O
rein	I
.	O

Remember	O
,	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
want	O
your	O
horse	I
's	O
hindquarters	I
to	O
go	O
in	O
,	O
so	O
you	O
wo	O
n't	O
use	O
too	O
much	O
leg	I
for	O
that	O
reason	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
have	O
this	O
control	O
over	O
the	O
shoulders	I
,	O
then	O
I	O
can	O
bend	I
left	O
and	O
control	O
the	O
turning	O
.	O

So	O
I	O
ride	I
a	O
large	O
walk	I
pirouette	I
like	O
this	O
:	O

1	O
.	O

Maintaining	O
the	O
left	O
bend	I
,	O
I	O
turn	O
him	O
left	O
with	O
the	O
right	O
hand	I
using	O
very	O
little	O
leg	I
.	O

2	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
my	O
horse	I
turns	O
in	O
pirouette	I
,	O
I	O
ask	O
him	O
to	O
go	O
out	O
again	O
from	O
the	O
inside	I
leg	I
and	O
rein	I
.	O

I	O
always	O
want	O
this	O
control	O
of	O
the	O
shoulders	I
,	O
so	O
from	O
the	O
inside	I
rein	I
,	O
I	O
neck	I
rein	I
the	O
shoulders	I
out	O
while	O
keeping	O
the	O
left	O
bend	I
.	O

3	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
confirm	O
that	O
control	O
with	O
the	O
inside	I
rein	I
,	O
I	O
turn	O
again	O
with	O
the	O
outside	I
rein	I
.	O

I	O
confirm	O
these	O
aids	I
to	O
be	O
sure	O
he	O
responds	O
immediately	O
:	O
He	O
goes	O
out	O
from	O
inside	I
rein	I
and	O
leg	I
and	O
in	O
from	O
mostly	O
the	O
outside	I
rein	I
.	O

He	O
turns	O
left	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
bring	O
my	O
right	O
hand	I
left	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
moves	O
out	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
take	O
my	O
left	O
hand	I
to	O
the	O
right	O
.	O

As	O
you	O
review	O
the	O
pirouette	I
in	O
walk	I
,	O
do	O
it	O
bigger	O
and	O
smaller	O
,	O
quicker	O
and	O
slower	O
.	O

Those	O
are	O
all	O
the	O
corrections	O
you	O
will	O
need	O
to	O
make	O
later	O
in	O
canter	I
.	O

You	O
'll	O
need	O
to	O
sometimes	O
do	O
it	O
larger	O
,	O
sometimes	O
smaller	O
,	O
sometimes	O
quicker	O
and	O
sometimes	O
slower	O
.	O

When	O
you	O
can	O
make	O
those	O
adjustments	O
in	O
size	O
and	O
speed	O
in	O
the	O
walk	I
,	O
then	O
you	O
will	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
do	O
the	O
same	O
in	O
canter	I
.	O

When	O
my	O
horse	I
understands	O
the	O
concepts	O
of	O
turning	O
with	O
bend	I
in	O
the	O
walk	I
,	O
he	O
will	O
understand	O
it	O
in	O
canter	I
,	O
too	O
.	O

Now	O
Train	I
the	O
Canter	I
Pirouette	I

When	O
the	O
walk	I
pirouette	I
is	O
well	O
confirmed	O
,	O
I	O
make	O
it	O
a	O
bit	O
quicker,?and	O
then	O
even	O
quicker	O
.	O

I	O
tap	O
him	O
?	O
with	O
the	O
whip	I
and	O
ask	O
for	O
canter	I
.	O

I	O
want	O
just	O
one	O
jump	I
of	O
canter	I
pirouette	I
,	O
and	O
the	O
moment	O
my	O
horse	I
does	O
it	O
,	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
Oh	O
!	O

Good	O
!	O
and	O
then	O
I	O
walk	I
out	O
of	O
it	O
and	O
give	O
him	O
a	O
break	O
.	O

Soon	O
my	O
horse	I
knows	O
that	O
if	O
I	O
go	O
into	O
pirouette	I
in	O
walk	I
and	O
I	O
start	O
to	O
make	O
him	O
quicker	O
,	O
he	O
knows	O
I	O
will	O
ask	O
for	O
canter	I
.	O

Then	O
he	O
knows	O
he	O
will	O
get	O
a	O
break	O
and	O
I	O
will	O
praise	I
him	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
he	O
canters	I
,	O
I	O
stop	O
and	O
praise	I
him	O
.	O

I	O
want	O
only	O
one	O
jump	I
of	O
canter	I
.	O

When	O
the	O
horse	I
is	O
confirmed	O
in	O
taking	O
one	O
balanced	I
stride	I
of	O
canter	I
pirouette	I
,	O
I	O
take	O
the	O
next	O
step	O

I	O
say	O
to	O
my	O
horse	I
,	O
I	O
did	O
n't	O
see	O
the	O
first	O
jump	I
.	O

Can	O
you	O
give	O
me	O
one	O
more	O
jump	I
?	O

Slowly	O
the	O
horse	I
learns	O
to	O
stay	O
on	O
the	O
spot	O
and	O
take	O
one	O
,	O
two	O
and	O
then	O
three	O
steps	I
of	O
canter	I
pirouette	I

Just	O
as	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
start	O
with	O
15	O

or	O
15	O
piaffe	I
steps	I

it	O
's	O
the	O
same	O
with	O
the	O
pirouette	I

I	O
'm	O
happy	O
if	O
I	O
get	O
one	O
stride	I
,	O
then	O
two	O
,	O
then	O
three	O
strides	I
that	O
are	O
balanced	I

Remember	O
what	O
he	O
has	O
learned	O
from	O
the	O
walk	I
pirouettes	I

that	O
he	O
can	O
make	O
a	O
stride	I
bigger	O

quicker	O
or	O

When	O
you	O
have	O
all	O
those	O
skills	O
,	O
you	O
can	O
do	O
your	O
pirouette	I
from	O
a	O

horse	I
find	O
the	O
balance	I
in	O
pirouette	I
on	O
the	O
weaker	O
hind	I
leg	I
.	O

In	O
travers	I
,	O
you	O
put	O
the	O
pressure	O
on	O
the	O
outside	I
hind	I
leg	I
,	O
and	O
in	O
shoulder-in	I
you	O
put	O
the	O
pressure	O
on	O
the	O
inside	I
hind	I
leg	I
.	O

If	O
your	O
horse	I
's	O
canter	I
is	O
good	O
to	O
the	O
left	O
but	O
the	O
right	O
is	O
not	O
good	O
,	O
then	O
when	O
you	O
go	O
right	O
,	O
you	O
should	O
start	O
it	O
from	O
shoulder-in	I
instead	O
of	O
travers	I
.	O

I	O
get	O
the	O
hind	I
leg	I
a	O
little	O
bit	O
out	O
so	O
there	O
's	O
more	O
pressure	O
on	O
the	O
right	I
hind	I
leg	I
when	O
I	O
do	O
the	O
pirouette	I
right	I
.	O

Then	O
you	O
can	O
do	O
pirouette	I
left	I
from	O
travers	I
so	O
the	O
right	I
hind	I
leg	I
again	O
takes	O
the	O
pressure	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
way	O
,	O
you	O
do	O
pirouette	I
with	O
the	O
pressure	O
on	O
whichever	O
hind	I
leg	I
you	O
want	O
.	O

Sometimes	O
it	O
only	O
takes	O
a	O
few	O
weeks	O
before	O
the	O
horse	I
is	O
comfortable	O
taking	O
the	O
weight	O
on	O
either	O
hind	I
leg	I
,	O
and	O
you	O
can	O
do	O
the	O
pirouette	I
equally	O
to	O
both	O
sides	O
.	O

You	O
can	O
do	O
the	O
pirouette	I
so	O
there	O
is	O
more	O
pressure	O
on	O
one	O
leg	I
or	O
the	O
other	O
or	O
the	O
same	O
on	O
both	O
.	O

You	O
can	O
level	O
it	O
out	O
in	O
a	O
way	O
that	O
makes	O
it	O
easier	O
for	O
the	O
horse	I
to	O
turn	O

This	O

When	O

a	O
