Q	O
:	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
riding	I
my	O
own	O
First	I
Level	I
Freestyle	I
and	O
observing	O
at	O
the	O
higher	O
levels	O
.	O

I	O
notice	O
that	O
some	O
rides	I
are	O
polished	O
and	O
others	O
are	O
not	O
.	O

Can	O
you	O
tell	O
me	O
some	O
general	O
ways	O
I	O
can	O
polish	O
my	O
ride	I
?	O

Also	O
,	O
I	O
am	O
wondering	O
what	O
happens	O
if	O
my	O
music	O
stops	O
during	O
my	O
test	I
.	O

Do	O
I	O
start	O
over	O
?	O

A	O
:	O
When	O
rider	I
first	O
began	O
doing	O
Freestyles	I
,	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
connection	O
between	O
the	O
music	O
and	O
the	O
movements	I
.	O

But	O
now	O
,	O
most	O
people	O
are	O
aware	O
that	O
the	O
beat	O
of	O
the	O
music	O
must	O
match	O
the	O
footfall	I
of	O
the	O
horse	I
.	O

This	O
is	O
good	O
because	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
trot	I
,	O
the	O
judge	I
will	O
be	O
looking	O
for	O
the	O
front	I
legs	I
to	O
match	O
the	O
beat	O
of	O
the	O
music	O
as	O
they	O
strike	O
the	O
ground	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
canter	I
,	O
the	O
lead	I
leg	I
must	O
be	O
in-sync	O
with	O
the	O
beat	O
.	O

I	O
think	O
the	O
newest	O
challenge	O
facing	O
freestyle	I
riders	I
is	O
in	O
remembering	O
to	O
present	O
an	O
entire	O
program	O
.	O

Riders	I
are	O
linking	O
disparate	O
pieces	O
of	O
music	O
together	O
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
the	O
pieces	O
match	O
the	O
footfalls	I
and	O
change	O
when	O
the	O
gaits	I
change	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
selections	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
a	O
cohesive	O
sound	O
.	O

The	O
various	O
selections	O
must	O
be	O
linked	O
either	O
by	O
coming	O
from	O
the	O
same	O
genre	O
(	O
jazz	O
,	O
classical	O
,	O
show	O
tunes	O
)	O
,	O
having	O
a	O
theme	O
(	O
children	O
's	O
music	O
,	O
Irish	O
music	O
,	O
Broadway	O
)	O
or	O
at	O
least	O
having	O
the	O
same	O
instrumentation	O
(	O
all	O
orchestral	O
,	O
all	O
small	O
band	O
,	O
guitar	O
as	O
a	O
feature	O
instrument	O
)	O
.	O

That	O
's	O
what	O
holds	O
the	O
program	O
together	O
.	O

Another	O
way	O
to	O
give	O
added	O
impact	O
to	O
your	O
program	O
is	O
to	O
interpret	O
your	O
music	O
.	O

For	O
instance	O
,	O
when	O
you	O
hear	O
the	O
phrasing	O
change	O
within	O
a	O
piece	O
,	O
think	O
about	O
how	O
you	O
can	O
express	O
that	O
change	O
with	O
your	O
horse	I
's	O
movement	O
.	O

The	O
most	O
critical	O
issue	O
involved	O
in	O
giving	O
your	O
freestyle	I
a	O
true	O
polish	O
,	O
though	O
,	O
is	O
the	O
editing	O
of	O
your	O
music	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
crucial	O
because	O
your	O
composition	O
should	O
n't	O
sound	O
as	O
if	O
you	O
dashed	O
it	O
together	O
the	O
night	O
before	O
.	O

Ask	O
yourself	O
if	O
the	O
editing	O
is	O
disruptive	O
or	O
if	O
there	O
are	O
long	O
pauses	O
between	O
sections	O
.	O

If	O
so	O
,	O
then	O
the	O
editing	O
needs	O
to	O
be	O
tighter	O
.	O

Just	O
as	O
you	O
expect	O
your	O
transitions	I
from	O
gait	I
to	O
gait	I
or	O
from	O
movement	I
to	O
movement	I
to	O
be	O
fluid	O
,	O
you	O
must	O
expect	O
the	O
transitions	I
in	O
your	O
music	O
to	O
be	O
clean	O
and	O
smooth	O
.	O

Seek	O
the	O
help	O
of	O
a	O
professional	O
editor	O
.	O

Not	O
only	O
will	O
your	O
musical	O
transitions	I
be	O
good	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
sound	O
will	O
be	O
clean	O
and	O
crisp	O
,	O
too	O
.	O

Then	O
,	O
when	O
you	O
come	O
down	O
centerline	I
,	O
you	O
can	O
have	O
confidence	O
that	O
you	O
will	O
have	O
good	O
sound	O
quality	O
.	O

Having	O
well-recorded	O
music	O
is	O
even	O
more	O
important	O
because	O
the	O
sound	O
systems	O
at	O
shows	I
are	O
often	O
poor	O
.	O

In	O
fact	O
,	O
I	O
recently	O
went	O
to	O
a	O
CDI-W	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
music	O
just	O
stopped	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
someone	O
's	O
ride	I
.	O

That	O
poor	O
rider	I
spent	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
time	O
to	O
get	O
that	O
far	O
,	O
and	O
this	O
problem	O
certainly	O
was	O
unexpected	O
.	O

If	O
this	O
technical	O
glitch	O
happens	O
