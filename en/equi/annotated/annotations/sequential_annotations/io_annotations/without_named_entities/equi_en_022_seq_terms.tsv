This	O
is	O
an	O
elegant	O
pair	O
.	O

Horse	I
and	O
rider	I
are	O
well	O
turned	O
out	O
.	O

Although	O
glove	I
color	O
is	O
not	O
specified	O
by	O
the	O
AHSA	O
,	O
I	O
wish	O
the	O
rider	I
would	O
not	O
show	O
in	O
black	O
gloves	I
.	O

White	O
gloves	I
are	O
more	O
traditionally	O
correct	O
and	O
would	O
enhance	O
this	O
picture	O
.	O

The	O
rider	I
has	O
a	O
lovely	O
position	O
and	O
should	O
be	O
proud	O
of	O
her	O
correct	O
rein	I
position	O
.	O

The	O
horse	I
is	O
calm	O
,	O
round	I
and	O
balanced	I
in	O
the	O
canter	I
and	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
paying	O
excellent	O
attention	O
to	O
his	O
rider	I
,	O
who	O
also	O
is	O
paying	O
excellent	O
attention	O
to	O
her	O
horse	I
.	O

However	O
,	O
there	O
are	O
things	O
that	O
could	O
make	O
this	O
picture	O
even	O
better	O
.	O

There	O
is	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
much	O
of	O
a	O
moment	I
of	I
suspension	I
in	O
this	O
canter	I
.	O

It	O
needs	O
more	O
jump	I
.	O

The	O
horse	I
is	O
not	O
jumping	I
enough	O
to	O
lift	O
himself	O
off	O
the	O
ground	O
after	O
the	O
landing	O
of	O
the	O
right	O
fore	O
.	O

I	O
can	O
see	O
this	O
because	O
the	O
right	O
hind	O
has	O
not	O
landed	O
far	O
enough	O
under	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
body	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
left	I
hind	I
toe	I
is	O
still	O
in	O
the	O
sand	O
.	O

If	O
he	O
were	O
jumping	I
better	O
,	O
the	O
right	O
hind	O
would	O
have	O
landed	O
closer	O
to	O
the	O
line	O
drawn	O
through	O
the	O
rider	I
's	O
body	O
:	O
ear	I
,	O
shoulder	I
,	O
hip	I
,	O
heel	I
,	O
instead	O
of	O
12	O
to	O
14	O
inches	O
behind	O
her	O
heel	I
.	O

In	O
the	O
very	O
moment	O
pictured	O
here	O
,	O
the	O
rider	I
should	O
try	O
to	O
activate	I
the	O
hind	I
quarters	I
of	O
her	O
horse	I
,	O
inspiring	O
him	O
to	O
jump	I
more	O
under	O
himself	O
in	O
the	O
next	O
stride	I
,	O
and	O
then	O
the	O
next	O
,	O
until	O
he	O
understands	O
that	O
she	O
wants	O
him	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
active	I
behind	O
.	O

He	O
is	O
trying	O
to	O
please	O
her	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
obvious	O
from	O
his	O
willing	O
,	O
attentive	O
expression	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
probably	O
assumes	O
that	O
this	O
flat	O
canter	I
is	O
what	O
she	O
wants	O
.	O

Although	O
she	O
should	O
not	O
get	O
angry	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
she	O
should	O
make	O
it	O
clear	O
that	O
she	O
wants	O
more	O
jump	I
in	O
the	O
canter	I
she	O
should	O
explain	O
this	O
through	O
seat	I
and	O
lower	I
leg	I
pressure	O
,	O
reinforced	O
with	O
a	O
light	O
touch	O
of	O
the	O
whip	I
behind	O
her	O
leg	I
.	O

The	O
canter	I
pictured	O
,	O
although	O
harmonious	O
and	O
smooth	O
looking	O
,	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
sufficient	O
impulsion	I
and	O
engagement	I
to	O
do	O
upper-level	O
movements	I
such	O
as	O
half	I
pass	I
or	O
pirouettes	I
in	O
the	O
collected	I
canter	I
.	O

Lower-level	O
training	I
should	O
prepare	O
the	O
horse	I
for	O
upper-level	O
collection	I
.	O

This	O
means	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
lower	O
levels	O
,	O
the	O
rider	I
should	O
develop	O
the	O
gaits	I
to	O
produce	O
the	O
engagement	I
and	O
strength	O
the	O
horse	I
will	O
need	O
to	O
perform	O
the	O
upper-level	O
work	O
.	O

This	O
rider	I
's	O
excellent	O
seat	I
will	O
provide	O
her	O
with	O
the	O
ability	O
to	O
get	O
more	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
basics	O
with	O
her	O
horse	I
