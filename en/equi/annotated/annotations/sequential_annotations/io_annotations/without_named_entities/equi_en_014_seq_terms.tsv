The	O
longer	O
you	O
have	O
been	O
posting	I
bumping	O
into	O
your	O
horse	I
's	O
back	I
,	O
the	O
more	O
you	O
will	O
need	O
to	O
consciously	O
retrain	O
your	O
mind	O
and	O
body	O
to	O
recognize	O
the	O
correct	O
balance	I
.	O

The	O
first	O
place	O
to	O
start	O
will	O
be	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
your	O
saddle	I
fit	O
and	O
balance	I
.	O

When	O
the	O
saddle	I
is	O
on	O
your	O
horse	I
's	O
back	I
,	O
the	O
lowest	O
place	O
of	O
the	O
seat	I
should	O
be	O
centered	O

Often	O
the	O
saddle	I
has	O
the	O
lowest	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
seat	I
in	O
the	O
back	O
half	O
of	O
the	O
saddle	I

When	O
the	O
saddle	I
is	O
out	O
of	O
balance	I
like	O
that	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
hard	O
for	O
any	O
rider	I
to	O
post	I
easily	O

Have	O
your	O
instructor	I
stand	O
next	O
to	O
you	O
in	O
your	O

at	O
a	O
halt	I

With	O
you	O
sitting	O
in	O
the	O
center	O
of	O
the	O

your	O
body	O
should	O
be	O
in	O
vertical	O

with	O
your	O
shoulders	I
over	O
your	O

your	O
hips	I
over	O
your	O

If	O
your	O
feet	I
are	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
the	O
vertical	O
line	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
quite	O
difficult	O
to	O
control	O
your	O
balance	I
while	O
posting	I

If	O
it	O
looks	O
like	O
your	O
saddle	I
may	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
low	O
in	O
back	O
,	O
try	O
putting	O
a	O
folded	O
towel	O
under	O
the	O
cantle	I
to	O
raise	O
the	O
back	O

Then	O
try	O
posting	I

If	O
this	O
makes	O
posting	I
easier	O
,	O
you	O
might	O
need	O
to	O
have	O
your	O
saddle	I
adjusted	O
or	O
reflocked	I

Once	O
your	O

there	O
