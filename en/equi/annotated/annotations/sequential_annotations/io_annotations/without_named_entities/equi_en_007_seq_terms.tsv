Half-pass	I

The	O
half-pass	I
is	O
a	O
lateral	I
movement	I
seen	O
in	O
dressage	I
,	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
horse	I
moves	O
forward	I
and	O
sideways	I
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
.	O

Unlike	O
the	O
easier	O
leg-yield	I
,	O
the	O
horse	I
is	O
bent	I
in	O
the	O
direction	I
of	I
travel	I
,	O
slightly	O
around	O
the	O
rider	I
's	O
inside	I
leg	I
.	O

The	O
outside	I
hind	O
and	O
forelegs	I
should	O
cross	I
over	I
the	O
inside	I
legs	I
,	O
with	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
body	O
parallel	O
to	O
the	O
arena	I
wall	I
and	O
his	O
forehand	I
leading	O
.	O

The	O
horse	I
should	O
remain	O
forward	I
,	O
balanced	I
,	O
and	O
bent	I
,	O
moving	O
with	O
cadence	I
.	O

The	O
inside	I
hind	I
leg	I
remains	O
engaged	I
throughout	O
the	O
half-pass	I
,	O
and	O
the	O
horse	I
should	O
not	O
lose	O
its	O
rhythm	I
.	O

The	O
half-pass	I
is	O
a	O
variation	O
of	O
haunches-in	I
(	O
travers	I
)	O
,	O
executed	O
on	O
a	O
diagonal	I
line	I
instead	O
of	O
along	O
the	O
wall	I
.	O

At	O
higher	O
levels	O
it	O
is	O
used	O
to	O
perform	O
a	O
counter-change	I
of	I
hand	I
,	O
combining	O
more	O
than	O
two	O
half-passes	I
with	O
changes	O
of	O
direction	O
in	O
a	O
zig-zag	O
pattern	O
.	O

The	O
Half-Pass	I
vs.	O
the	O
Leg-Yield	I

The	O
half-pass	I
requires	O
more	O
balance	I
,	O
engagement	I
,	O
and	O
collection	I
from	O
a	O
horse	I
than	O
the	O
leg-yield	I
.	O

This	O
is	O
because	O
the	O
horse	I
is	O
slightly	O
bent	I
in	O
the	O
direction	I
of	I
movement	I
in	O
the	O
half-pass	I
.	O

In	O
the	O
leg-yield	I
,	O
the	O
horse	I
is	O
fairly	O
straight	I
or	O
looking	O
slightly	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
direction	I
of	I
travel	I
.	O

The	O
Purpose	O
of	O
the	O
Half-Pass	I

The	O
half-pass	I
is	O
a	O
schooling	I
movement	I
that	O
requires	O
the	O
horse	I
to	O
engage	I
the	O
hindquarters	I
and	O
increase	O
its	O
impulsion	I
,	O
it	O
can	O
therefore	O
be	O
used	O
to	O
improve	O
both	O
collection	I
or	O
impulsion	I
.	O

The	O
half-pass	I
is	O
commonly	O
seen	O
in	O
dressage	I
tests	I
beginning	O
at	O
the	O
United	O
States	O
Dressage	I
Federation	O
third	I
level	I
.	O

Performing	O
the	O
maneuver	O

A	O
common	O
method	O
of	O
introducing	O
the	O
half-pass	I
:	O
riding	I
a	O
half	I
10-meter	I
circle	I
,	O
and	O
half-passing	I
from	O
the	O
centerline	I
back	O
to	O
the	O
rail	I
.	O

In	O
half-pass	I
the	O
horse	I
is	O
looking	O
into	O
the	O
direction	I
of	I
travel	I
,	O
bent	I
around	O
the	O
rider	I
's	O
inner	I
leg	I
,	O
with	O
the	O
forelegs	I
slightly	O
leading	O
and	O
the	O
outside	I
legs	I
crossing	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
the	O
inside	I
legs	I
.	O

The	O
half-pass	I
is	O
usually	O
taught	O
after	O
the	O
haunches-in	I
is	O
well	O
confirmed	O
.	O

It	O
may	O
first	O
be	O
introduced	O
by	O
riding	I
a	O
half-10-meter	I
circle	I
from	O
the	O
long	I
side	I
to	O
the	O
centerline	I
,	O
or	O
a	O
half-volte	I
,	O
and	O
then	O
half-passing	I
in	O
.	O

The	O
circle	I
naturally	O
places	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
body	O
in	O
the	O
correct	O
bend	I
,	O
and	O
helps	O
to	O
encourage	O
the	O
engagement	I
needed	O
for	O
the	O
movement	I
.	O

The	O
outside	I
hind	I
leg	I
must	O
step	I
well	O
under	I
the	O
horse	I
's	O
body	O
to	O
push	O
the	O
animal	O
forward	I
and	O
sideways	I
.	O

A	O
rider	I
uses	O
an	O
active	I
outside	I
leg	I
slightly	O
behind	O
the	O
neutral	O
position	O
to	O
ask	O
the	O
horse	I
to	O
step	I
forward	O
and	O
under	O
.	O

The	O
outside	I
rein	I
maintains	O
the	O
correct	O
bend	I
and	O
contains	O
the	O
energy	O
of	O
the	O
horse	I
,	O
the	O
inside	I
leg	I
keeps	O
the	O
horse	I
moving	O
forward	I
,	O
and	O
the	O
inside	I
rein	I
guides	O
the	O
forehand	I
in	O
the	O
direction	I
of	I
movement	I
.	O

The	O
rider	I
also	O
uses	O
his	O
or	O
her	O
inside	I
seat	I
bone	I
to	O
help	O
maintain	O
bend	I
.	O

If	O
the	O
rider	I
is	O
off-center	O
or	O
twisted	O
,	O
the	O
horse	I
will	O
also	O
be	O
crooked	I
or	O
off-balance	I
.	O

If	O
the	O
horse	I
loses	O
quality	O
in	O
the	O
movement	I
,	O
such	O
as	O
lack	O
of	O
correct	O
bend	I
(	O
haunches	I
leading	O
or	O
inside	I
shoulder	I
falling	O
inward	O
)	O
,	O
loss	O
of	O
rhythm	I
,	O
or	O
stiffness	O
,	O
the	O
rider	I
straightens	I
the	O
horse	I
and	O
rides	I
forward	I

The	O
beginning	O
and	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
movement	I
needs	O
special	O
attention	O
