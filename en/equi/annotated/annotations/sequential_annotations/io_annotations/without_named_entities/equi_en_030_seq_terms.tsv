She	O
hemmed	O

said	O
she	O

But	O
she	O
did	O

how	O
to	O
get	O
to	O

she	O
's	O
not	O

Rhythm	I

Rhythm	I
is	O
the	O

's	O
the	O

That	O

the	O

You	O

if	O

your	O
work	O
in	O
rhythm	I

The	O
terms	O
working	I
trot	I
and	O
working	I
canter	I
were	O
coined	O
as	O
a	O
way	O
of	O
helping	O
the	O
rider	I
search	O
for	O
the	O
rhythm	I
and	O
the	O
tempo	I
(	O
which	O
is	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
rhythm	I
)	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
horse	I
can	O
work	O
most	O
economically	O
.	O

Some	O
horses	I
,	O
because	O
of	O
lack	O
of	O
balance	I
,	O
are	O
inclined	O
to	O
get	O
quicker	O

some	O
are	O
inclined	O
to	O
slow	O
down	O
like	O

winding	O
down	O
.	O

If	O
you	O
can	O
improve	O
the	O
consistency	O
of	O
your	O
horse	I
's	O
rhythm	I
,	O
you	O
improve	O
his	O
balance	I
,	O
his	O
comfort	O
and	O
the	O
economy	O
with	O
which	O
he	O
moves	O
.	O

Inherent	O
in	O
rhythm	I
is	O
the	O
flexion	I
of	O
one	O
set	O
of	O
muscles	I
and	O
the	O
relaxation	I
of	O
the	O
opposite	O
muscles	I
,	O
and	O
then	O
,	O
of	O
course	O
,	O
the	O
one	O
set	O
of	O
muscles	I
relax	I
and	O
the	O
opposite	O
ones	O
flex	I
.	O

Hence	O
,	O
when	O
working	O
in	O
rhythm	I
,	O
all	O
the	O
muscles	I
get	O
a	O
moment	O
of	O
relaxation	I
within	O
every	O
stride	I
.	O

That	O
's	O
why	O
well-trained	I
dressage	I
horses	I
often	O
live	O
long	O
,	O
useful	O
lives	O
.	O

The	O
rhythm	I
of	O
the	O
working	I
trot	I
varies	O
from	O
horse	I
to	O
horse—between	I
about	O
140	O
beats	I
per	I
minute	I
(	O
bpm	I
)	O
and	O
160	O
bpm—depending	I
on	O
your	O
horse	I
's	O
size	O
and	O
his	O
way	O
of	O
moving	O
,	O
but	O
if	O
your	O
horse	I
's	O
trot	I
is	O
,	O
for	O
example	O
,	O
148	O
bpm	I
,	O
he	O
must	O
be	O
consistent	O
.	O

You	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
rider	I
,	O
can	O
help	O
him	O
maintain	O
a	O
consistent	O
rhythm	I
and	O
tempo	I
.	O

The	O
tempo	I
of	O
the	O
canter	I
is	O
usually	O
about	O
96	O
bpm	I
and	O
the	O
tempo	I
of	O
the	O
walk	I
is	O
often	O
about	O
100	O
bpm	I
.	O

If	O
you	O
ride	I
with	O
a	O
metronome	O
,	O
you	O
can	O
work	O
on	O
helping	O
your	O
horse	I
retain	O
the	O
tempo	I
of	O
this	O
rhythm	I
.	O

Then	O
you	O
learn	O
,	O
without	O
the	O
metronome	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
metronome	O
for	O
your	O
horse	I
.	O

You	O
can	O
also	O
use	O
cavalletti	I
to	O
give	O
you	O
and	O
your	O
horse	I
the	O
feeling	O
for	O
correct	O
rhythm	I

As	O
an	O
aside	O
,	O
self-perpetuating	O
rhythm	I
in	O
motion	O
not	O
only	O
improves	O
the	O
horse	I

physical	O
balance	I

also	O
his	O
mental	O
balance	I
and	O
the	O
rider	I

something	O

about	O

The	O
USDF	O
says	O
that	O
the	O
second	O
step	O
of	O
the	O
Training	I
Scale	I
is	O
Relaxation	I
.	O

Remember	O
the	O
flexion	I
and	O
relaxation	I
that	O
occur	O
when	O
the	O
rhythm	I
is	O
consistent	O
?	O

When	O
that	O
moment	O
of	O
relaxation	I
is	O
missing	O
,	O
you	O
ca	O
n't	O
go	O
much	O
farther	O
in	O
the	O
training	I
of	O
your	O
horse	I
because	O
development	O
requires	O
that	O
muscles	I
receive	O
the	O
circulation	O
of	O
blood	O
and	O
oxygen	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
strengthen	O
.	O

Of	O
course	O
,	O
we	O
all	O
know	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
hard	O
enough	O
sometimes	O
to	O
relax	I
ourselves	O
let	O
alone	O
try	O
to	O
help	O
another	O
living	O
being	O
(	O
who	O
is	O
sometimes	O
nervous	O
or	O
frightened	O
)	O
to	O
relax	I
.	O

Within	O
the	O
sport	O
of	O
dressage	I
,	O
there	O
are	O
many	O
basic	O
exercises	I
that	O
help	O
horses	I
relax	I
.	O

Most	O
,	O
if	O
not	O
all	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
entail	O
bending	I
and	O
stretching	I
.	O

Bending	I
promotes	O
lateral	I
relaxation	I
and	O
stretching	I
promotes	O
longitudinal	I
relaxation	I
.	O

Studying	O
a	O
sport	O
that	O
has	O
fans	O
from	O
different	O
cultures	O
has	O
complications	O
,	O
but	O
also	O
has	O
the	O
enriching	O
aspect	O
of	O
revealing	O
the	O
subtleties	O
between	O
different	O
languages	O
.	O

So	O
the	O
international	O
governing	O
body	O
,	O
the	O
FEI	O
,	O
calls	O
the	O
second	O
step	O
of	O
the	O
Training	I
Scale	I
Suppleness—another	I
English	O
word	O
that	O
has	O
slightly	O
more	O
meaning	O
.	O

It	O
can	O
be	O
said	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
be	O
relaxed	I
but	O
not	O
supple	I
(	O
such	O
as	O
when	O
you	O
're	O
lying	O
on	O
the	O
beach	O
)	O
,	O
but	O
you	O
ca	O
n't	O
be	O
supple	I
without	O
relaxation	I
.	O

Suppleness	I
implies	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
relaxation	I
as	O
well	O
as	O
some	O
amount	O
of	O
energy	O
working	O
through	O
the	O
body	O
.	O

So	O
the	O
ideal	O
jogger	O
is	O
relaxed	I
and	O
supple	I
.	O

The	O
horse	I
ca	O
n't	O
really	O
bend	I
and	O
stretch	I
well	O
without	O
being	O
relaxed	I
and	O
supple	I
.	O

But	O
encouraging	O
him	O
to	O
bend	I
and	O
stretch	I
promotes	O
both	O
of	O
these	O
qualities	O
.	O

Patience	O

When	O
the	O
first	O
three	O
elements	O
of	O
the	O
Training	I
Scale	I
are	O
understood	O
and	O
demonstrated	O
by	O
both	O
horse	I
and	O
rider	I
,	O
they	O
present	O
a	O
lovely	O
picture	O
.	O

The	O
ideal	O
Training	I
Level	I
horse	I
is	O
beautiful	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
attaining	O
this	O
level	O
should	O
n't	O
take	O
forever	O
.	O

Three	O
-	O
and	O
4-year-old	O
horses	I
are	O
often	O
born	O
to	O
go	O
forward	I
in	O
a	O
clear	O
and	O
steady	O
rhythm	I
,	O
be	O
supple	I
and	O
accept	O
contact	I
with	O
the	O
bit	I
.	O

So	O
do	O
n't	O
set	O
the	O
bar	O
too	O
low	O
.	O

Clinicians	O
often	O
see	O
young	O
horses	I
who	O
are	O
inconsistent	O
,	O
not	O
on	I
the	I
bit	I
,	O
tense	O
and	O
demonstrating	O
poor	O
rhythm	I
.	O

The	O
excuse	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
horse	I
is	O
young	O
.	O

But	O
often	O
the	O
rider	I
is	O
n't	O
even	O
making	O
her	O
wishes	O
known	O
clearly	O
to	O
the	O
horse	I

Patience	O
is	O
sometimes	O
a	O
virtue	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
if	O
the	O
horse	I
is	O
uncomfortable	O
and	O
out	O
of	O
balance	I
just	O
because	O
the	O
rider	I
has	O
n't	O
helped	O

Contact	I
and	O
Connection	I

The	O
word	O
Contact	I
refers	O
to	O
the	O
feel	O
between	O
the	O
rider	I
's	O
hand	I
and	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
mouth	I
.	O

The	O
Connection	I
is	O
between	O
the	O
hindquarters	I
and	O
the	O
forehand	I
of	O
the	O
horse	I
.	O

You	O
can	O
have	O
contact	I
without	O
connection	I
but	O
you	O
can	O
not	O
have	O
connection	I
without	O
contact	I
.	O

How	O
does	O
the	O
contact	I
develop	O
the	O
connection	I
?	O

When	O
the	O
horse	I
goes	O
forward	I
in	O
a	O
clear	O
and	O
steady	O
rhythm	I
and	O
he	O
's	O
also	O
relaxed	I
and	O
supple	I
,	O
the	O
energy	O
goes	O
from	O
a	O
thrusting	I
hind	I
leg	I
through	O
the	O
relaxed	I
,	O
swinging	I
back	I
and	O
to	O
the	O
bit	I
.	O

The	O
horse	I
is	O
trained	I
,	O
from	O
the	O
beginning	O
,	O
to	O
reach	O
for	O
the	O
bit	I
and	O
accept	O
contact	I
.	O

And	O
he	O
is	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
,	O
trained	I
to	O
go	O
forward	I
in	O
a	O
clear	O
and	O
steady	O
rhythm	I
with	O
relaxation	I
and	O
suppleness—the	I
first	O
two	O
qualities	O
in	O
the	O
Training	I
Scale	I
.	O

Not	O
to	O
oversimplify	O
,	O
but	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
the	O
first	O
two	O
qualities	O
,	O
then	O
the	O
development	O
of	O
contact	I
has	O
come	O
along	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
.	O

And	O
when	O
the	O
back	I
is	O
swinging	I
,	O
the	O
connection	I
between	O
the	O
hindquarters	I
and	O
the	O
bit	I
develops	O
,	O
too	O
.	O

There	O
are	O
energy	O
pathways	O
of	O
throughness	I
:	O
The	O
horse	I
thrusts	I
from	O
the	O
left	I
hind	I
leg	I
to	O
the	O
bit	I
on	O
the	O
left	O
and	O
from	O
the	O
right	I
hind	I
leg	I
to	O
the	O
bit	I
on	O
the	O
right	O
.	O

These	O
two	O
pathways	O
are	O
unilateral	O
.	O

There	O
are	O
two	O
other	O
important	O
pathways	O
of	O
energy	O
that	O
are	O
diagonal	O
:	O
The	O
energy	O
can	O
go	O
from	O
the	O
left	O
hind	O
to	O
the	O
right	I
rein	I
when	O
the	O
horse	I
is	O
bent	I
left	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
energy	O
can	O
go	O
from	O
the	O
right	I
hind	I
leg	I
to	O
the	O
left	I
rein	I
when	O
the	O
horse	I
is	O
bent	I
right	O
.	O

Hence	O
,	O
the	O
importance	O
of	O
riding	I
inside	I
leg	I
to	O
outside	I
rein	I
so	O
the	O
horse	I
can	O
balance	I
on	O
that	O
outside	I
rein	I
.	O

When	O
the	O
energy	O
from	O
the	O
hindquarters	I
reaches	O
the	O
bit	I
and	O
half	I
halts	I
return	O
the	O
energy	O
to	O
the	O
hindquarters	I
,	O
then	O
the	O
rider	I
has	O
successfully	O
connected	I
the	O
hindquarters	I
and	O
the	O
forehand	I
of	O
the	O
horse	I
.	O

The	O
horse	I
is	O
not	O
allowed	O
to	O
lean	O
on	I
the	I
bit	I
,	O
but	O
rather	O
he	O
should	O
carry	O
it	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
contact	I
is	O
too	O
strong	O
and	O
the	O
horse	I
is	O
using	O
the	O
contact	I
to	O
carry	O
some	O
of	O
his	O
weight	O
,	O
the	O
rider	I
must	O
half	I
halt	I
and	O
/	O
or	O
do	O
transitions	I
with	O
aids	I
that	O
encourage	O
the	O

(	O
in	O

the	O

of	O
gravity—in	O
the	O
space	O
between	O
the	O

The	O

Impulsion	I
and	O
Schwung	I

Impulsion	I
is	O
thrust	I
or	O
the	O
release	O
of	O

You	O
can	O
see	O
that	O

is	O
related	O
to	O
rhythm	I
,	O
or	O
the	O
sequence	O
of	O
the	O
footfall	I

because	O
the	O
release	O
of	O
stored	O
energy	O
happens	O
only	O
during	O
the	O
moment	O
of	O
thrust	I
.	O

In	O
contrast	O
,	O
the	O
moment	O
of	O

The	O
