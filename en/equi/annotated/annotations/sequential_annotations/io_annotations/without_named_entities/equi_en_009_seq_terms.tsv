A	O
pirouette	I
is	O
a	O
two-track	I
lateral	I
movement	I
asked	O
of	O
a	O
horse	I
in	O
dressage	I
,	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
animal	O
makes	O
a	O
circle	O
with	O
its	O
front	I
end	I
around	O
a	O
smaller	O
circle	O
made	O
by	O
the	O
hind	I
end	I
.	O

Specifically	O
,	O
the	O
front	I
legs	I
and	O
outside	I
hind	I
leg	I
should	O
travel	O
around	O
the	O
inside	I
hind	I
leg	I
,	O
with	O
the	O
horse	I
remaining	O
slightly	O
bent	I
in	O
the	O
direction	I
of	I
travel	I
.	O

From	O
the	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
rider	I
it	O
needs	O
much	O
practice	O
in	O
collecting	I
and	O
balancing	I
the	O
horse	I
and	O
in	O
using	O
the	O
aids	I
correctly	O
.	O

The	O
horse	I
may	O
perform	O
the	O
movement	I
at	O
the	O
walk	I
or	O
canter	I
,	O
although	O
the	O
pirouette	I
at	O
the	O
walk	I
is	O
more	O
commonly	O
called	O
the	O
turn	I
on	I
the	I
haunches	I
.	O

It	O
can	O
also	O
be	O
executed	O
at	O
piaffe	I
.	O

As	O
in	O
all	O
dressage	I
,	O
the	O
horse	I
should	O
remain	O
relaxed	I
,	O
engaged	I
,	O
and	O
responsive	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
poll	I
as	O
the	O
highest	O
point	O
.	O

Ideally	O
,	O
the	O
pirouette	I
will	O
be	O
almost	O
in-place	O
,	O
although	O
many	O
horses	I
perform	O
a	O
slightly	O
larger	O
pirouette	I
.	O

A	O
pirouette	I
may	O
be	O
performed	O
either	O
as	O
a	O
360-degree	O
turn	O
(	O
full	I
pirouette	I
)	O
,	O
270	O
degrees	O

or	O
180-degrees	O

Some	O
dressage	I
tests	I
call	O

two	O
full	I
pirouettes	I
in	O
a	O

Number	O
of	O
beats	I
and	O
strides	I

The	O
walk	I
stride	I
has	O
to	O
consist	O
of	O
four	O
beats	I

Pivoting	O
around	O
one	O
hindleg	I
without	O
lifting	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
considered	O
a	O
correct	O
movement	I
:	O
The	O
inside	I
hind	I
foot	I
is	O
raised	O
and	O
put	O
down	O
almost	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
place	O
.	O

When	O
performed	O
at	O
the	O
canter	I
,	O
the	O
gait	I
actually	O
is	O
meant	O
to	O
remain	O
a	O
three-beat	I
action	O
with	O
a	O
moment	I
of	I
suspension	I
.	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
high	O
level	O
of	O
collection	I
,	O
strength	O
and	O
discipline	O
required	O
means	O
that	O
it	O
often	O
degenerates	O
into	O
an	O
incorrect	O
four-beat	I
motion	O
.	O

The	O
correct	O
half-pirouette	I
in	O
canter	I
should	O
take	O
three	O
steps	I
or	O
strides	I
,	O
the	O
whole	O
pirouette	I
should	O
take	O
six	O
to	O
eight	O
strides	I

Faults	O

The	O
canter	I
pirouette	I
is	O
a	O
very	O
difficult	O
exercise	I
when	O
performed	O
correctly	O
.	O

The	O
horse	I
should	O
not	O
throw	O
his	O
body	O
around	O
,	O
fall	I
inward	I
,	O
or	O
let	O
his	O
hindquarters	I
fall	I
to	I
the	I
outside	I
,	O
but	O
should	O
remain	O
balanced	I
.	O

The	O
horse	I
should	O
not	O
plant	O
one	O
of	O
his	O
hind	I
legs	I
and	O
move	O
around	O
it—as	O
seen	O
in	O
the	O
western	I
spin—but	O
should	O
lift	O
them	O
up	O
and	O
place	O
them	O
down	O
with	O
each	O
stride	I
,	O
maintaining	O
the	O
purity	O
of	O
the	O
gait	I
.	O

The	O
horse	I
should	O
not	O
lose	O
the	O
rhythm	I
of	O
the	O
canter	I
,	O
or	O
fall	O
onto	O
his	O
forehand	I
.	O

The	O
horse	I
should	O
not	O
make	O
an	O
oval-shaped	O
movement	O
with	O
his	O
hindquarters	I
,	O
but	O
should	O
inscribe	O
a	O
perfect	O
circle	O
.	O

The	O
horse	I
should	O
never	O
step	I
back	O
.	O

Each	O
bound	I
should	O
be	O
equal	O
.	O

It	O
must	O
not	O
degenerate	O
into	O
a	O
four-beat	I
motion	O
or	O
lose	O
its	O
moment	I
of	I
suspension	I
