16	O
tips	O
we	O
learned	O
from	O

session	O
:	O

1	O
.	O

When	O
you	O
are	O
teaching	O
your	O
horse	I
something	O
new	O
,	O
begin	O
on	O
his	O
good	O
side	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
positive	O
experience	O
.	O

2	O
.	O

When	O
you	O
are	O
teaching	O
piaffe	I
,	O
passage	I
and	O
pirouettes	I
it	O
is	O
best	O
to	O
do	O
everything	O
in	O
short	O
sets	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
better	O
to	O
do	O
many	O
short	O
spurts	O
than	O
a	O
few	O
over	O
an	O
extended	O
period	O
,	O
Charlotte	O
said	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
important	O
not	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
horse	I
muscle-sore	I
when	O
you	O
are	O
first	O
asking	O
for	O
more	O
collection	I
.	O

3	O
.	O

Think	O
about	O
riding	I
your	O
horse	I
up	O
and	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
you	O
.	O

Every	O
chance	O
you	O
get	O
,	O
put	O
your	O
hands	I
forward	O
so	O
you	O
can	O
meet	O
the	O
contact	I
out	O
further	O
.	O

Keep	O
thinking	O
about	O
the	O
frame	I
and	O
keeping	O
your	O
horse	I
growing	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
you	O
.	O

Both	O
horses	I
Charlotte	O
was	O
working	O
with	O
had	O
a	O
tendency	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
short	O
in	O
the	O
neck	I
.	O

4	O
.	O

As	O
you	O
transition	I
between	O
medium	I
,	O
working	I
and	O
collected	I
gaits	I
,	O
focus	O
on	O
riding	I
tactful	I
transitions	I
while	O
keeping	O
your	O
horse	I
's	O
neck	I
long	O
.	O

Again	O
she	O
was	O
referring	O
to	O
the	O
two	O
horses	I
who	O
had	O
a	O
tendency	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
short	O
in	O
the	O
neck	I
.	O

5	O
.	O

If	O
you	O
struggle	O
to	O
maintain	O
power	O
in	O
the	O
trot	I
,	O
just	O
think	O
about	O
riding	I
medium	I
trot	I
without	O
actually	O
performing	O
medium	I
trot	I
.	O

Having	O
a	O
medium-trot	I
mentality	O
should	O
create	O
a	O
better	O
trot	I
.	O

6	O
.	O

To	O
ensure	O
correct	O
bend	I
in	O
the	O
haunches-in	I
,	O
imagine	O
wrapping	O
your	O
horse	I
's	O
body	O
around	O
your	O
inside	I
leg	I
.	O

7	O
.	O

As	O
you	O
prepare	O
to	O
ride	I
a	O
half	I
pass	I
,	O
make	O
sure	O
that	O
you	O
get	O
a	O
good	O
quality	O
shoulder-in	I
first	O
.	O

It	O
ensures	O
that	O
you	O
start	O
with	O
good	O
bend	I
and	O
an	O
uphill	I
balance	I
when	O
you	O
begin	O
the	O
half	I
pass	I
.	O

8	O
.	O

If	O
you	O
find	O
the	O
half	I
pass	I
challenging	O
,	O
try	O
this	O
exercise	I
:	O

Ride	I
shoulder-in	I
.	O

Ride	I
a	O
10-meter	I
circle	I
.	O

Return	O
to	O
shoulder-in	I
for	O
a	O
few	O
strides	I
.	O

Turn	O
the	O
shoulder-in	I
into	O
half	I
pass	I
.	O

This	O
exercise	I
is	O
effective	O
because	O
it	O
breaks	O
down	O
the	O
pieces	O
of	O
the	O
half	I
pass	I
(	O
shoulder-in	I
and	O
the	O
10-meter	I
circle	I
)	O
and	O
then	O
puts	O
them	O
back	O
together	O
in	O
a	O
logical	O
sequence	O
.	O

9	O
.	O

When	O
you	O
school	I
half	I
pass	I
,	O
do	O
n't	O
stay	O
in	O
the	O
movement	I
for	O
too	O
long	O
.	O

Go	O
back	O
to	O
shoulder-in	I
to	O
regain	O
the	O
bend	I
if	O
you	O
lose	O
it	O
.	O

Charlotte	O
likes	O
to	O
initially	O
school	I
walk	I
pirouettes	I
on	O
a	O
big	O
square	O

As	O

In	O

work	O

remember	O
to	O
give	O
your	O
horse	I
room	O
in	O
the	O
outside	I

One	O
thing	O
I	O
see	O
a	O
lot	O
when	O
people	O
do	O
walk	I
pirouettes	I
is	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
too	O
strong	O
in	O
the	O
outside	I

If	O
you	O
restrain	O
the	O
horse	I
too	O
much	O
with	O
the	O
outside	I

,	O
you	O
wo	O

do	O
n't	O
focus	O
on	O

I	O
always	O

so	O
I	O
can	O

I	O

to	O

she	O

21	O

To	O
straighten	I
your	O
horse	I

think	O
of	O
putting	O
him	O
in	O

from	O
the	O
poll	I
to	O
the	O
tail	I

the	O
outside	I

In	O
young	O
horses	I
(	O

all	O
horses	I

,	O
you	O
can	O
promote	O
throughness	I

relaxation	I
and	O
rhythm	I
by	O
riding	I
lots	O
of	O
trot–canter–trot	I

25	O
.	O

Notice	O
that	O
the	O
concept	O
of	O
relaxation	I
has	O
two	O
components	O
:	O
Relaxation	I
means	O
that	O
the	O
horse	I
is	O
physically	O
and	O
mentally	O
tension	O
free	O
.	O

26	O

Young	O
horses	I
must	O
learn	O
to	O
go	O
forward	I
and	O
stay	O
forward	I
while	O
remaining	O
calm	O
.	O

Your	O
horse	I
's	O
desire	O
to	O
go	O
forward	I
must	O
be	O
greater	O
than	O
your	O
need	O
to	O
remind	O
him	O
.	O

But	O
he	O
must	O
stay	O
calm	O
in	O
his	O
mind	O
and	O
loose	O
in	O
his	O
body	O

Encourage	O
your	O
horse	I
to	O
cover	O
ground	O

Feel	O
in	O
your	O
seat	I
that	O
your	O
horse	I
is	O
working	O
from	O
his	O
hind	I

toward	O
the	O

28	O
.	O

Do	O
not	O
teach	O
collection	I
to	O
a	O
young	O
horse	I
too	O
early	O

Use	O
exercises	I
that	O
naturally	O
encourage	O
collection	I
without	O
mentally	O
forcing	O
it	O
.	O

29	O
.	O

You	O
can	O
use	O
exercises	I
like	O
shoulder-fore	I
and	O
10-meter	I
circles	I
to	O
naturally	O
encourage	O
collection	I
.	O

Leg	I
yield	I
is	O
useful	O
because	O
it	O
teaches	O
the	O
horse	I
to	O
go	O
forward	I
with	O
a	O
degree	O
of	O
sideways	I
.	O

30	O

When	O
teaching	O
a	O
young	O
horse	I
the	O
shoulder-fore	I
,	O
try	O
this	O
exercise	I
:	O

Ride	I
down	O

Leg	I
yield	I
to	O
the	O
rail	I

a	O
baby	O
shoulder-in	I

When	O
the	O
horse	I
loses	O
forwardness	I
and	O
impulsion	I
,	O
straighten	I
him	O
and	O
go	O
forward	I

The	O
leg	I
yield	I
makes	O
the	O
horse	I
move	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
inside	I
leg	I
,	O
the	O
circle	I
makes	O
sure	O
he	O
understands	O
the	O
direction	O
of	O
the	O
front	I
end	I
,	O
then	O
the	O
shoulder-in	I
combines	O
those	O
two	O
ideas	O
.	O

31	O
.	O

As	O
you	O
work	O
toward	O
collection	I
,	O
do	O
n't	O
forget	O
about	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
forwardness	I
.	O

You	O
need	O
the	O
forwardness	I
because	O
you	O
must	O
have	O
something	O
to	O
collect	I
.	O

32	O
.	O

Stretching	I
is	O
important	O
in	O
every	O
schooling	I
session	O
,	O
but	O
do	O
n't	O
let	O
your	O
horse	I
think	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
break	O
from	O
the	O
work	O

supposed	O
to	O
be	O
associated	O

Do	O
not	O
underestimate	O
the	O
value	O
of	O
a	O
20-meter	I
circle	I

The	O
work	O
toward	O
half	I
pass	I
actually	O
begins	O
on	O
the	O
20-meter	I
circle	I

This	O
is	O
because	O
you	O
are	O

When	O

that	O
the	O

This	O
should	O
be	O
coupled	O
with	O
the	O

toward	O
obedience	I

Throughout	O
the	O

Steffen	O
explained	O
the	O
importance	O
of	O
working	O
within	O
your	O
horse	I

comfort	O
zone	O
and	O
tailoring	O
your	O
program	O
to	O
what	O
is	O
most	O
productive	O
for	O
his	O
specific	O
needs	O

He	O
also	O
emphasized	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
quiet	O

precise	O
aids	I

Here	O
are	O
the	O
tips	O
Steffen	O
left	O

with	O

Steffen	O
explained	O
that	O
Legolas	O
has	O
really	O
good	O
gaits	I
,	O
but	O
he	O
is	O
not	O
the	O
most	O
supple	I
horse	I
.	O

He	O
is	O
also	O
extremely	O
sensitive	O
,	O
which	O
can	O
be	O
both	O
an	O
advantage	O
and	O
a	O
disadvantage	O
.	O

To	O
get	O
the	O
most	O
out	O
of	O
him	O
,	O
Steffen	O
said	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
working	O
his	O
body	O
in	O
a	O
position	O
that	O
makes	O
him	O
feel	O
most	O
comfortable	O
.	O

For	O
every	O
horse	I
,	O
you	O
must	O
find	O
the	O
most	O
productive	O
frame	I
and	O
the	O
most	O
productive	O
tempo	I
,	O
he	O
said	O
.	O

For	O
Legolas	O
,	O
Steffen	O
finds	O
it	O
most	O
productive	O
to	O
ride	I
in	O
a	O
rounder	O
frame	I
and	O
a	O
slower-tempo	I
trot	I
.	O

55	O
.	O

To	O
address	O
suppleness	I
in	O
the	O
warm-up	I
,	O
Steffen	O
has	O
a	O
go-to	O
exercise	I
:	O

Trot	I
down	O
the	O
long	I
side	I
in	O
counter	I
flexion	I
.	O

As	O
you	O
approach	O
the	O
short	I
side	I
,	O
turn	O
early	O
and	O
transition	I
to	O
true	O
flexion	I
.	O

As	O
your	O
horse	I
is	O
in	O
true	O
flexion	I
,	O
leg	I
yield	I
away	O
from	O
your	O
inside	I
leg	I
.	O

Ride	I
this	O
exercise	I
equally	O
in	O
both	O
directions	O
.	O

56	O
.	O

Do	O
not	O
be	O
afraid	O
to	O
let	O
hot	O
horses	I
go	O
forward	I
.	O

It	O
's	O
tempting	O
to	O
ride	I
hot	O
horses	I
too	O
collected	I
,	O
he	O
said	O
.	O

Half	I
pass	I
is	O
a	O
good	O
movement	I
for	O
hot	O
horses	I
because	O
it	O
allows	O
you	O
to	O
actually	O
put	O
your	O
leg	I
on	O
while	O
the	O
horse	I
moves	O
sideways	I
.	O

57	O
.	O

Remember	O
to	O
take	O
breaks	O
.	O

Even	O
with	O
hotter	O
horses	I
,	O
it	O
's	O
important	O
to	O
give	O
them	O
a	O
break	O

It	O
's	O
not	O
such	O
a	O
good	O
idea	O
to	O
wear	O
them	O
out	O

Even	O
if	O
the	O
break	O
is	O
just	O
for	O
30	O
seconds	O

Building	O
strength	O
is	O
gradual	O

Strength	O
comes	O
from	O
brief	O
moments	O
of	O
asking	O
for	O
more	O
effort	O

59	O
.	O

Stick	O
with	O
what	O
works	O
in	O
the	O
training	I

Do	O
n't	O
change	O
the	O
routine	O
too	O
much	O

60	O

The	O
horse	I
should	O
have	O
respect	O
for	O
the	O
bit	I
and	O
should	O
respond	O
to	O
the	O
smallest	O
of	O
aids	I

When	O
we	O
touch	O
a	O
horse	I
on	O
the	O
inside	I

he	O
should	O
bend	I
to	O
the	O
inside	I

When	O
I	O
touch	O
the	O
bit	I
ever	O
so	O
slightly	O

the	O
horse	I
must	O
answer	O
to	O
this	O

Get	O
comfortable	O
with	O
centerlines	I

We	O
ride	I
centerlines	I
all	O
the	O

the	O

some	O

We	O

The	O

It	O

If	O

You	O

The	O

happy	O
in	O
his	O

What	O

It	O
