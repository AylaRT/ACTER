Uncover	O
the	O
Mystery	O
of	O
On	I
the	I
Bit	I

A	O
horse	I
who	O
is	O
on	I
the	I
bit	I
trusts	O
the	O
rider	I
's	O
aids	I
and	O
accepts	O
the	O
contact	I
with	O
the	O
bit	I
.	O

When	O
ridden	I
,	O
horses	I
can	O
truly	O
forget	O
their	O
instinctive	O
behavior	O
to	O
fight	O
or	O
flee	O
.	O

One	O
element	O
that	O
makes	O
this	O
possible	O
is	O
teaching	O
the	O
horse	I
to	O
accept	O
the	O
aids	I
so	O
he	O
can	O
be	O
ridden	I
on	I
the	I
bit	I
.	O

The	O
Aids	I
and	O
Contact	I

The	O
rider	I
must	O
be	O
in	O
a	O
balanced	I
,	O
secure	O
and	O
vertical	O
position	O
with	O
independent	I
aids	I
before	O
she	O
can	O
ask	O
the	O
horse	I
to	O
be	O
on	I
the	I
bit	I
.	O

The	O
seat	I
and	O
leg	I
should	O
be	O
the	O
rider	I
's	O
dominant	O
aids	I
.	O

The	O
rider	I
has	O
the	O
most	O
weight	O
and	O
strength	O
in	O
these	O
aids	I
and	O
the	O
horse	I
hears	O
them	O
best	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
hands	I
are	O
the	O
invitational	O
aids	I
.	O

You	O
should	O
feel	O
that	O
you	O
allow	O
your	O
hands	I
to	O
play	O
more	O
of	O
an	O
orchestrating	O
role	O
than	O
a	O
dominating	O
role	O
.	O

In	O
other	O
words	O
,	O
the	O
horse	I
first	O
responds	O
to	O
the	O
leg	I
and	O
is	O
energetic	O
and	O
moving	O
through	O
the	O
back	I
so	O
he	O
wants	O
to	O
stretch	I
to	O
the	O
contact	I
,	O
then	O
the	O
rein	I
can	O
invite	O
him	O
to	O
the	O
contact	I
correctly	O
.	O

The	O
contact	I
is	O
as	O
unique	O
to	O
every	O
horse	I
and	O
rider	I
as	O
a	O
handshake	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
noticed	O
a	O
huge	O
variation	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
people	O
shake	O
hands	I
in	O
terms	O
of	O
the	O
strength	O
of	O
grip	O
and	O
the	O
feel	O
.	O

The	O
rider	I
must	O
offer	O
the	O
horse	I
a	O
friendly	O
,	O
inviting	O
contact	I
so	O
the	O
horse	I
wants	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
it	O
and	O
stay	O
there	O
.	O

For	O
correct	O
contact	I
,	O
the	O
rider	I
must	O
offer	O
the	O
reins	I
and	O
give	O
the	O
horse	I
a	O
nice	O
feeling	O
to	O
look	O
for	O
.	O

Sometimes	O
the	O
reins	I
are	O
too	O
tight	O
or	O
too	O
stiff	O
,	O
sometimes	O
they	O
are	O
too	O
loose	O
or	O
unsteady	O
.	O

The	O
rider	I
must	O
make	O
the	O
rein	I
come	O
alive	O
with	O
energy	O
from	O
her	O
body	O
toward	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
mouth	I
.	O

Otherwise	O
,	O
the	O
contact	I
can	O
be	O
a	O
limiting	O
factor	O
in	O
whether	O
the	O
horse	I
can	O
be	O
on	I
the	I
bit	I
.	O

A	O
common	O
problem	O
with	O
the	O
rein	I
aids	I
is	O
that	O
they	O
can	O
become	O
backward	O
.	O

Sometimes	O
,	O
the	O
rider	I
does	O
n't	O
understand	O
how	O
to	O
keep	O
the	O
elastic	O
contact	I
with	O
the	O
reins	I
and	O
incorrectly	O
brings	O
her	O
hands	I
backward	O
to	O
influence	O
the	O
horse	I
.	O

Sometimes	O
the	O
reins	I
get	O
too	O
long	O
and	O
the	O
hands	I
come	O
back	O
to	O
feel	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
mouth	I
.	O

Sometimes	O
,	O
the	O
rider	I
is	O
n't	O
balanced	I
enough	O
in	O
her	O
seat	I
so	O
she	O
pulls	O
back	O
to	O
balance	I
on	O
the	O
reins	I
.	O

In	O
any	O
case	O
,	O
the	O
horse	I
can	O
not	O
be	O
invited	O
onto	O
the	O
bit	I
with	O
backward	O
contact	I
because	O
it	O
prevents	O
the	O
energy	O
in	O
the	O
connection	I
from	O
moving	O
from	O
back	O
to	O
front	O
.	O

On	I
the	I
Bit	I

A	O
horse	I
who	O
is	O
on	I
the	I
bit	I
trusts	O
the	O
rider	I
's	O
aids	I
and	O
accepts	O
the	O
contact	I
with	O
the	O
bit	I
.	O

He	O
does	O
not	O
lean	O
and	O
pull	O
on	O
the	O
bit	I
nor	O
does	O
he	O
hide	O
from	O
it	O
;	O
he	O
seeks	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
horse	I
reaches	O
for	O
the	O
contact	I
with	O
the	O
poll	I
as	O
the	O
highest	O
point	O
and	O
the	O
front	O
of	O
his	O
face	O
on	O
or	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
the	O
vertical	O
.	O

To	O
see	O
the	O
position	O
of	O
the	O
head	I
and	O
neck	I
,	O
you	O
may	O
want	O
to	O
ride	I
in	O
an	O
arena	I
with	O
mirrors	O
or	O
be	O
videotaped	O
.	O

You	O
can	O
always	O
see	O
what	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
head	I
looks	O
like	O
from	O
the	O
top	O
but	O
that	O
is	O
often	O
not	O
enough	O
information	O
until	O
you	O
have	O
fine-tuned	O
your	O
feel	O
.	O

To	O
the	O
rider	I
,	O
when	O
the	O
horse	I
is	O
on	I
the	I
bit	I
you	O
feel	O
like	O
you	O
are	O
sitting	O
on	O
a	O
wave	O
that	O
flows	O
forward	O
under	O
your	O
seat	I
and	O
through	O
the	O
contact	I
to	O
the	O
bit	I
then	O
is	O
recycled	O
back	O
through	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
body	O
in	O
a	O
continuous	O
and	O
fluid	O
cycle	O
.	O

I	O
feel	O
the	O
horse	I
is	O
balanced	I
between	O
my	O
seat	I
,	O
legs	I
and	O
hands	I
,	O
accepts	O
the	O
influence	O
of	O
my	O
aids	I
both	O
laterally	O
and	O
longitudinally	O
and	O
accepts	O
the	O
contact	I
in	O
an	O
elastic	O
way	O
with	O
relaxation	I
and	O
trust	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
magical	O
experience	O
once	O
you	O
feel	O
it	O
and	O
know	O
it	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
mind	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
's	O
on	I
the	I
bit	I
,	O
he	O
accepts	O
your	O
directions	O
and	O
focuses	O
on	O
you	O
no	O
matter	O
what	O
is	O
going	O
on	O
around	O
him	O
.	O

A	O
round	I
and	O
through	I
horse—when	I
the	O
rider	I
's	O
aids	I
can	O
pass	O
through	O
the	O
horse	I
without	O
restriction	O
from	O
back	O
to	O
front	O
and	O
front	O
to	O
back—forgets	O
his	O
instinctive	O
nature	O
to	O
raise	O
his	O
head	I
and	O
instead	O
focuses	O
on	O
the	O
rider	I
.	O

Putting	O
the	O
horse	I
correctly	O
on	I
the	I
bit	I
develops	O
a	O
partnership	O
with	O
him	O
.	O

He	O
gives	O
you	O
that	O
feeling	O
that	O
he	O
wants	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
you	O
and	O
wants	O
to	O
be	O
ridden	I
.	O

He	O
can	O
give	O
you	O
his	O
mind	O
and	O
body	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
emotionally	O
fulfilling	O
and	O
a	O
requirement	O
to	O
developing	O
harmony	O
.	O

Some	O
riders	I
perceive	O
that	O
the	O
horse	I
should	O
be	O
overcontrolled	O
in	O
front	O
.	O

This	O
results	O
in	O
a	O
short	O
neck	I
and	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
face	O
behind	O
the	O
vertical	O
.	O

The	O
problem	O
sometimes	O
results	O
from	O
a	O
misunderstanding	O
of	O
the	O
contact	I
or	O
fear	O
of	O
a	O
strong	O
horse	I
,	O
but	O
a	O
horse	I
being	O
ridden	I
too	O
tightly	O
or	O
overflexed	O
in	O
front	O
can	O
also	O
suffer	O
some	O
possible	O
neck	I
damage	O
and	O
back	I
issues	I
.	O

The	O
position	O
limits	O
the	O
horse	I
's	O
ability	O
to	O
use	O
his	O
back	I
and	O
neck	I
correctly	O
and	O
therefore	O
be	O
through	I
.	O

To	O
be	O
on	I
the	I
bit	I
,	O
the	O
horse	I
must	O
accept	O
the	O
connection	I
