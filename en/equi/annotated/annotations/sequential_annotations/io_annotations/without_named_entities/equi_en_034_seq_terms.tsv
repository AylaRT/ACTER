How	O
to	O
set	O
up	O
an	O
organized	O
,	O
effective	O
program	O
for	O
your	O
dressage	I
horse	I
.	O

For	O
centuries	O
,	O
the	O
gymnastic	I
training	I
system	O
of	O
dressage	I
has	O
proven	O
highly	O
effective	O
for	O
both	O
starting	O
young	O
horses	I
and	O
schooling	I
up	O
through	O
Grand	I
Prix	I
.	O

It	O
works	O
for	O
creatures	O
of	O
habit	O
,	O
like	O
the	O
horse	I
,	O
because	O
it	O
allows	O
them	O
to	O
know	O
what	O
is	O
expected	O
and	O
is	O
very	O
regimented	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
because	O
everything	O
you	O
begin	O
at	O
Training	I
Level	I
is	O
the	O
first	O
step	O
on	O
the	O
journey	O
to	O
upper-level	O
work	O
.	O

It	O
's	O
systematic	O
,	O
meaning	O
that	O
nothing	O
ever	O
really	O
changes—the	O
aids	I
are	O
always	O
the	O
same	O
through	O
each	O
level	O
of	O
training	I
.	O

For	O
example	O
,	O
the	O
aids	I
for	O
a	O
well-ridden	I
20-meter	I
circle	I
are	O
almost	O
the	O
same	O
as	O
the	O
aids	I
for	O
a	O
canter	I
pirouette	I
.	O

The	O
only	O
difference	O
is	O
that	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
higher	O
levels	O
,	O
the	O
horse	I
is	O
stronger	O
because	O
the	O
rider	I
has	O
incorporated	O
all	O
the	O
other	O
elements	O
of	O
the	O
training	I
scale—rhythm	I
,	O
suppleness	I
,	O
contact	I
,	O
impulsion	I
,	O
straightness	I
and	O
collection	I
.	O

Over	O
the	O
years	O
,	O
I	O
have	O
found	O
that	O
this	O
systematic	O
training	I
works	O
for	O
all	O
horses	I
,	O
regardless	O
of	O
their	O
breed	I
.	O

I	O
have	O
also	O
learned	O
the	O
importance	O
of	O
incorporating	O
certain	O
factors	O
into	O
my	O
dressage	I
training	I
and	O
I	O
would	O
like	O

Recognizing	O
your	O
horse	I

physical	O
and	O
mental	O
capabilities	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
important	O
part	O
of	O
his	O
training	I

For	O
example	O
,	O
you	O
ca	O
n't	O
take	O
a	O

and	O
ask	O
him	O
to	O
do	O
15	O

You	O
have	O
to	O
build	O
up	O
your	O
horse	I
's	O
mental	O
ability	O
and	O
physical	O
fitness	O
through	O
systematic	O
gymnastic	I
exercises	I

You	O
start	O
out	O
small	O
and	O
increase	O
as	O
his	O
fitness	O
and	O
strength	O
grow	O

Some	O
people	O
make	O
the	O
mistake	O
of	O
riding	I
their	O
young	O
or	O
green	O
horse	I
twice	O
a	O
week	O
to	O
go	O
easy	O
on	O
him	O
.	O

That	O
's	O
the	O
worst	O
way	O
to	O
approach	O
his	O
training	I
because	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
systematic	O
.	O

A	O
lot	O
of	O
time	O
and	O
energy	O
are	O
wasted	O
because	O
he	O
comes	O
out	O
fresh	O
and	O
disobedient	O
and	O
does	O
n't	O
remember	O
much	O
from	O
the	O
last	O
time	O
he	O
was	O
ridden	I
.	O

The	O
better	O
plan	O
is	O
to	O
ride	I
for	O
20	O
minutes	O
six	O
days	O
a	O
week	O

That	O
consistency	O
will	O
build	O
his	O
physical	O
and	O
mental	O
fitness	O

Start	O
off	O
by	O
doing	O
basic	O
exercises	I
in	O
walk	I

He	O
should	O
be	O

to	O

As	O
the	O
horse	I
matures	O
and	O
gets	O
stronger	O
,	O
you	O
can	O
start	O
to	O
introduce	O
big	O
circles	I

big	O

a	O

Riding	I
him	O

fairly	O
and	O

will	O
set	O
him	O
up	O

He	O
will	O

a	O

foundation	O
for	O
further	O
training	I
by	O

Your	O

you	O

something	O

when	O

once	O
his	O

and	O
the	O

the	O

Today	O

I	O

If	O
your	O

is	O

,	O
he	O
will	O
resist	O
and	O
the	O

you	O

Is	O
he	O

enough	O
to	O
do	O
what	O
you	O
're	O

of	O
him	O
?	O

Is	O
he	O
physically	O

what	O

and	O
listen	O
to	O
your	O

all	O
the	O

You	O
may	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
a	O
few	O
steps	O
and	O
work	O
on	O
the	O
basics	O
through	O
systematic	O
gymnastic	I

And	O
keep	O
in	O

Gymnastic	I
Program	O

If	O
you	O
stick	O
to	O
a	O
program	O
,	O
your	O
horse	I
is	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
better	O
and	O
you	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
better	O
rider	I

Consistent	O
work	O
makes	O
training	I
kinder	O
because	O
riders	I
are	O
clearer	O
about	O
what	O
they	O
are	O
asking	O
for	O
and	O
horses	I
are	O
fit	O
enough	O
to	O
do	O
what	O

So	O
dressage	I

One	O
of	O
the	O
biggest	O
faults	O
in	O
dressage	I
training	I
is	O
that	O
people	O
do	O
n't	O
spend	O
enough	O
time	O
on	O
the	O
basics—rhythm	I
,	O
suppleness	I
and	O
contact	I

The	O
tricks	O
in	O
this	O

are	O
really	O

that	O
tough	O

,	O
pirouette	I

not	O
so	O
difficult	O

But	O
getting	O
the	O
horse	I
loose	O
,	O
getting	O
the	O
contact	I
right	O
and	O
having	O
a	O
horse	I
that	O
wants	O
to	O
perform	O
for	O
you	O
is	O
difficult	O
and	O
more	O
important	O
to	O
achieve	O
.	O

You	O
just	O
have	O
to	O
sit	O
there	O
like	O
you	O
're	O
in	O
halt	I
and	O
let	O
the	O
horse	I
do	O
his	O
job	O
underneath	O
you	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
you	O
start	O
clamping	O
and	O
forcing	O
,	O
you	O
create	O
tension	O
,	O
which	O
does	O
n't	O
work	O

A	O
systematic	O
gymnastic	I
approach	O
simplifies	O
the	O
training	I
,	O
which	O
allows	O
the	O
horse	I
and	O
rider	I
to	O
keep	O
a	O
positive	O
attitude	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
regimented	O
,	O
so	O
it	O
builds	O
up	O
confidence	O
in	O
both	O
horse	I
and	O
rider	I
because	O
they	O
know	O
what	O
is	O
expected	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

It	O
's	O
consistent	O
,	O
which	O
provides	O
a	O
clear	O
understanding	O
of	O
how	O
to	O
apply	O
and	O
build	O
on	O
the	O
aids	I
throughout	O
the	O
levels	O
.	O

And	O
it	O
makes	O
training	I
kinder	O
because	O
it	O
builds	O
on	O
the	O
physical	O
and	O
mental	O
fitness	O
of	O
your	O
horse	I
so	O
that	O
he	O
is	O
ready	O

willing	O
and	O
able	O
to	O
perform	O
what	O
