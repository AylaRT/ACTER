She	O

The	O

coined	O
as	O
a	O

If	O

the	O

Inherent	O

all	O

The	O
rhythm	B
of	O
the	O

from	O
horse	B

horse—between	B
about	O
140	O
beats	B

minute	I
(	O
bpm	B

on	O
your	O

his	O

148	O

You	O

the	O

can	O
help	O

maintain	O
a	O

The	O
tempo	B

about	O

the	O

If	O

work	O
on	O

your	O

retain	O
the	O

Then	O
you	O
learn	O

without	O
the	O

to	O
be	O
the	O

for	O
your	O

You	O

Relaxation	B

Remember	O
the	O

When	O
that	O

missing	O

you	O
ca	O
n't	O
go	O
much	O
farther	O
in	O
the	O
training	B
of	O
your	O
horse	B
because	O
development	O
requires	O
that	O
muscles	B
receive	O
the	O
circulation	O
of	O
blood	O
and	O
oxygen	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
strengthen	O

Of	O
course	O
,	O
we	O
all	O
know	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
hard	O
enough	O
sometimes	O
to	O
relax	B
ourselves	O
let	O
alone	O
try	O
to	O

living	O

(	O

sometimes	O

)	O
to	O

Within	O
the	O
sport	O
of	O
dressage	B
,	O
there	O
are	O
many	O
basic	O
exercises	B
that	O
help	O
horses	B
relax	B

Most	O
,	O
if	O
not	O
all	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
entail	O
bending	B

stretching	B

Bending	B
promotes	O
lateral	B
relaxation	I

longitudinal	B
relaxation	I

Studying	O
a	O
sport	O
that	O
has	O
fans	O
from	O
different	O
cultures	O
has	O
complications	O
,	O
but	O
also	O
has	O
the	O
enriching	O
aspect	O
of	O
revealing	O
the	O
subtleties	O
between	O
different	O
languages	O

So	O
the	O
international	O
governing	O
body	O
,	O
the	O
FEI	O
,	O
calls	O
the	O
second	O
step	O
of	O
the	O
Training	B
Scale	I
Suppleness—another	B
English	O
word	O
that	O
has	O
slightly	O
more	O
meaning	O
.	O

It	O
can	O
be	O
said	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
be	O
relaxed	B
but	O
not	O
supple	B
(	O
such	O
as	O
when	O
you	O
're	O
lying	O
on	O
the	O
beach	O
)	O
,	O
but	O
you	O
ca	O
n't	O
be	O
supple	B
without	O
relaxation	B
.	O

Suppleness	B
implies	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
relaxation	B
as	O
well	O
as	O
some	O
amount	O
of	O
energy	O
working	O
through	O
the	O
body	O
.	O

So	O
the	O
ideal	O
jogger	O
is	O
relaxed	B
and	O
supple	B
.	O

The	O
horse	B
ca	O
n't	O
really	O
bend	B
and	O
stretch	B
well	O
without	O
being	O
relaxed	B
and	O
supple	B
.	O

But	O
encouraging	O
him	O
to	O
bend	B
and	O
stretch	B
promotes	O
both	O
of	O
these	O
qualities	O

Patience	O

When	O
the	O
first	O
three	O
elements	O

understood	O

demonstrated	O
by	O
both	O
horse	B

rider	B
,	O
they	O
present	O
a	O
lovely	O
picture	O

The	O
ideal	O
Training	B

horse	B

beautiful	O

However	O
,	O
attaining	O
this	O

n't	O
take	O
forever	O

Three	O
-	O
and	O
4-year-old	O
horses	B
are	O
often	O
born	O
to	O
go	O

So	O
do	O
n't	O
set	O
the	O

Clinicians	O

young	O

not	O
on	B
the	I
bit	I

The	O
excuse	O
is	O
that	O
the	O

But	O
often	O
the	O

Patience	O

but	O
not	O
if	O
the	O

uncomfortable	O

out	O

the	O

Contact	B

The	O

the	O
rider	B

the	O

The	O
Connection	B
is	O
between	O

the	O
forehand	B
of	O
the	O

You	O

How	O
does	O
the	O
contact	B
develop	O
the	O

?	O

When	O
the	O
horse	B
goes	O

in	O
a	O
clear	O

and	O
he	O
's	O

And	O
he	O
is	O

at	O
the	O

to	O
go	O
forward	B
in	O
a	O

Not	O
to	O
oversimplify	O

but	O
if	O
you	O

the	O
first	O
two	O
qualities	O

then	O
the	O
development	O
of	O

has	O
come	O
along	O
at	O
the	O

And	O
when	O
the	O

There	O
are	O
energy	O
pathways	O

The	O

from	O
the	O
right	B

the	O

These	O
two	O
pathways	O
are	O
unilateral	O

There	O
are	O
two	O
other	O
important	O
pathways	O
of	O
energy	O
that	O
are	O
diagonal	O

The	O
energy	O
can	O
go	O
from	O
the	O

the	O

rein	I
when	O
the	O
horse	B

the	O

hind	I
leg	I
to	O
the	O
left	B
rein	I
when	O
the	O
horse	B
is	O

Hence	O
,	O
the	O
importance	O
of	O
riding	B
inside	B
leg	I
to	O
outside	B

so	O
the	O

half	B

the	O
energy	O

then	O
the	O

successfully	O
connected	B
the	O
hindquarters	B

The	O
horse	B

the	I

When	O
the	O

using	O
the	O

carry	O
some	O

the	O
