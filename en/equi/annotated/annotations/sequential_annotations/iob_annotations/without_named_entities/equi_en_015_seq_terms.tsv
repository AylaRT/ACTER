Alexandria	O
writes	O
that	O
she	O
is	O
successfully	O
competing	O
at	O
Second	B
Level	I
and	O
is	O
schooling	B
Third	B
Level	I
at	O

the	O
goal	O
of	O
earning	O
her	O
scores	O
for	O
her	O
USDF	O
bronze	O
medal	O
.	O

According	O
to	O
Alexandria	O
,	O
Coqui	O
had	O
only	O
been	O
ridden	B
in	O
reining	B
,	O
cattle	O
work	O
,	O
jumping	B
and	O
Western	B
pleasure	I
until	O
he	O
was	O
10	O
years	O
old	O
.	O

Then	O
she	O
introduced	O
him	O
to	O
dressage	B
and	O
now	O
they	O
're	O
working	O
their	O
way	O
up	O
through	O
the	O
levels	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
good	O
example	O
how	O
the	O
classical	O
,	O
correct	O
riding	B
system	O
allows	O
horses	B
of	O
all	O
types	O
and	O
ages	O
to	O
be	O
worked	O
correctly	O
and	O
stay	O
healthy	O
and	O
athletic	O
in	O
their	O
movement	O
.	O

In	O
her	O
note	O
,	O
Alexandria	O
very	O
accurately	O
describes	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
now	O
difficult	O
to	O
work	O
on	O
further	O
collection	B
and	O
more	O
lightness	B
of	O
the	O
shoulders	B
as	O
her	O
horse	B
is	O
,	O
by	O
nature	O
,	O
bred	B
and	O
built	O
more	O
downhill	O
.	O

She	O
also	O
reports	O
that	O
for	O
her	O
,	O
too	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
hard	O
to	O
keep	O
her	O
shoulders	B
back	O
and	O
that	O
she	O
has	O
the	O
habit	O
of	O
looking	O
down	O
.	O

I	O
often	O
notice	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
similarities	O
between	O
horse	B
and	O
rider	B
.	O

So	O
it	O
does	O
not	O
surprise	O
me	O
that	O
Coqui	O
and	O
Alexandria	O
are	O
both	O
showing	O
this	O
weak	O
spot	O
around	O
their	O
shoulders	B
.	O

Alexandria	O
correctly	O
describes	O
this	O
challenge	O
and	O
asks	O
for	O
help	O
in	O
addressing	O
it	O
.	O

Helping	O
a	O
horse	B
to	O
become	O
lighter	B
in	O
the	O
forehand	B
needs	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
support	O
and	O
stability	O
of	O
the	O
rider	B
's	O
upper	O
body	O
.	O

When	O
looking	O
at	O
the	O
picture	O
,	O
I	O
notice	O
that	O
Alexandria	O
is	O
riding	B
with	O
a	O
nice	O
long	O
leg	B
position	O
and	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
only	O
up	O
between	O
her	O
shoulders	B
that	O
she	O
rounds	O
.	O

She	O
looks	O
down	O
a	O
bit	B
and	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
result	O
,	O
her	O
arms	B
are	O
not	O
carried	O
enough	O
forward	O
.	O

Sometimes	O
one	O
can	O
build	O
up	O
support	O
and	O
strength	O
in	O
the	O
back	B
by	O
slightly	O
rounding	O
the	O
shoulders	B
and	O
keeping	O
the	O
upper	B
arms	I
and	O
elbows	B
a	O
bit	O
to	O
the	O
outside	B
.	O

This	O
creates	O
some	O
stretch	B
over	O
the	O
back	B
and	O
shoulder	B
area	O
and	O
that	O
can	O
help	O
for	O
a	O
better	O
connection	B
with	O
the	O
horse	B
.	O

However	O
,	O
this	O
rounding	O
creates	O
fake	O
stability	O
and	O
will	O
only	O
work	O
in	O
the	O
short	O
term	O
.	O

When	O
such	O
a	O
rider	B
tries	O
to	O
correct	O
the	O
round	O
shoulder	B
position	O
and	O
pulls	O
her	O
shoulders	B
back	O
and	O
down	O
,	O
she	O
often	O
becomes	O
unstable	O
in	O
the	O
core	B
and	O
lacks	O
feel	O
for	O
her	O
horse	B
's	O
needs	O
and	O
then	O
the	O
picture	O
becomes	O
more	O
stiff	O
than	O
stable	O
.	O

Instead	O
of	O
focusing	O
on	O
bringing	O
her	O
shoulders	B
back	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
advise	O
Alexandria	O
to	O
concentrate	O
more	O
on	O
the	O
movement	O
of	O
her	O
spine	B
.	O

Try	O
this	O
:	O
Sit	O
on	O
a	O
chair	O
and	O
feel	O
your	O
collarbones	B
all	O
the	O
way	O
from	O
your	O
sternum	B
to	O
the	O
sides	O
of	O
your	O
shoulders	B
.	O

Then	O
you	O
should	O
feel	O
down	O
the	O
vertebrae	O
of	O
your	O
neck	B
and	O
feel	O
the	O
one	O
bone	O
sticking	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
back	O
of	O
the	O
neck	B
the	O
farthest	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
the	O
lowest	O
cervical	B
segment	I
,	O
called	O
C7	B
.	O

To	O
mobilize	O
your	O
upper	B
thoracic	I
spine	I
,	O
you	O
should	O
imagine	O
a	O
movement	O
of	O
rounding	O
your	O
spine	B
by	O
letting	O
the	O
collarbones	B
move	O
down	O
while	O
the	O
C7	B
vertebra	I
pushes	O
up	O
.	O

Then	O
arch	O
your	O
upper	O
spine	B
by	O
lifting	O
your	O
collarbones	B
up	O
as	O
C7	B
moves	O
down	O
.	O

This	O
can	O
be	O
a	O
very	O
tiny	O
movement	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
has	O
great	O
influence	O
on	O
your	O
head	B
and	O
shoulder	B
position	O
and	O
your	O
influence	O
of	O
the	O
horse	B
.	O

Often	O
when	O
we	O
attempt	O
to	O
sit	O
up	O
straight	O
,	O
we	O
only	O
lift	O
our	O
chins	B
and	O
,	O
by	O
that	O
,	O
we	O
shorten	O
the	O
back	O
of	O
our	O
necks	B
,	O
which	O
is	O
not	O
healthy	O
.	O

Then	O
we	O
become	O
stiff	O
in	O
the	O
shoulders	B
by	O
holding	O
them	O
back	O
,	O
which	O
means	O
we	O
are	O
unable	O
to	O
keep	O
a	O
soft	O
,	O
giving	O
and	O
elastic	O
contact	B
with	O
the	O
horse	B
's	O
mouth	B
.	O

Instead	O
of	O
straightening	O
in	O
the	O
upper	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
spine	B
,	O
we	O
move	O
the	O
lower	O
ribs	B
forward	O
and	O
we	O
lean	O
back	O
.	O

This	O
stiffens	O
the	O
lower	B
back	I
and	O
prevents	O
us	O
from	O
following	B
the	O
horse	B
's	O
movement	O
smoothly	O
.	O

The	O
exercise	B
I	O
described	O
teaches	O
a	O
different	O
approach	O
to	O
straightening	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
body	O
and	O
connects	O
the	O
rider	B
more	O
with	O
the	O
seat	B
,	O
leaving	O
her	O
shoulders	B
free	O
and	O
independent	O
.	O

Instead	O
of	O
forcing	O
the	O
shoulders	B
back	O
,	O
the	O
chest	B
moves	O
forward	O
up	O
between	O
the	O
shoulders	B
and	O
this	O
allows	O
more	O
suppleness	B
combined	O
with	O
a	O
more	O
stable	O
core	B
.	O

I	O
describe	O
this	O
in	O
detail	O
because	O
this	O
will	O
become	O
the	O
key	O
for	O
Alexandria	O
to	O
bring	O
Coqui	O
into	O
a	O
higher	O
level	O
of	O
collection	B
.	O

Playing	O
between	O
a	O
tiny	O
curl	O
and	O
arch	O
movement	O
will	O
open	O
new	O
refined	O
levels	O
of	O
communication	O
between	O
her	O
and	O
her	O
mount	B
.	O

Once	O
she	O
gets	O
this	O
feeling	O
,	O
her	O
habit	O
of	O
looking	O
down	O
will	O
fade	O
out	O
of	O
her	O
riding	B
automatically	O
.	O

I	O
wish	O
Alexandria	O
and	O
Coqui	O
luck	O
and	O
success	O
on	O
their	O
way	O
up	O
