the	O

François	O

was	O
looking	O
for	O
an	O
exercise	B
that	O

Every	O

some	O
natural	O
crookedness	B

which	O
the	O

must	O
diminish	O
in	O

Horses	B
tend	O
to	O
fall	B
in	I
with	O
their	O
haunches	B
when	O
moving	O
on	O
a	O
straight	O
line	O
because	O
the	O
hindquarters	B
are	O
wider	O
than	O
the	O
shoulders	B

The	O
systematic	O
training	B
under	B

is	O
to	O
improve	O
this	O
natural	O

right-handedness	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
supple	B
horse	B
on	O
both	O

in	O
the	O

Suppleness	B
and	O
elasticity	O
in	O

,	O
however	O
,	O
are	O
fundamental	O
qualities	O
in	O
a	O
well-trained	B
dressage	B
horse	I

The	O
forward-sideways	B
moving	O
in	O
the	O
shoulder-in	B
helps	O
the	O

improve	O
the	O
horse	B

The	O
Aids	B
for	O
Shoulder-In	B

In	O
shoulder-in	B
,	O
the	O
horse	B
is	O
bent	B
around	O
the	O
rider	B
's	O
inside	B
leg	I
at	O
about	O
a	O
30-degree	O
angle	O
,	O
moving	O
forward	B
on	O
three	O
tracks	B
.	O

The	O
hindquarters	B
remain	O
on	O
the	O
first	B
track	I
,	O
while	O
the	O
rider	B
guides	O
the	O
forehand	B
toward	O
the	O
inside	B
of	O
the	O
arena	B
so	O
that	O
the	O
horse	B
's	O
inside	B
hind	I
leg	I
moves	O
in	O
the	O
direction	O
of	O
the	O
outside	B
front	I
leg	I
.	O

The	O
outside	B
hind	I
leg	I
is	O
on	O
the	O
first	B
track	I
,	O
the	O
inside	B
hind	I
leg	I
and	O
outside	B
front	I
leg	I
are	O
on	O
the	O
second	B
track	I
and	O
the	O
inside	B
front	I
leg	I
moves	O
on	O
the	O
third	B
track	I
.	O

Ideally	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
shoulder-in	B
,	O
the	O
rider	B
gives	O
the	O
horse	B
security	O
through	O
his	O
own	O
inner	O
balance	B
.	O

This	O
causes	O
the	O
horse	B
to	O
concentrate	O
more	O
on	O
the	O
rider	B
than	O
on	O
his	O
natural	O
instincts	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
crucial	O
that	O
the	O
rider	B
guides	O
the	O
horse	B
with	O
the	O
outside	B
rein	I
and	O
determines	O
the	O
degree	O
of	O
flexion	B
with	O
the	O
inside	B
rein	I
.	O

At	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
,	O
the	O
rider	B
increases	O
the	O
weight	O
on	O
his	O
inside	B
seat	I
bone	I
,	O
drives	B
the	O
horse	B
forward	B
/	I
sideways	I
with	O
his	O
inside	B
leg	I
at	B
the	I
girth	I
and	O
maintains	O
the	O
haunches	B
with	O
his	O
outside	B
leg	I
behind	B
the	I
girth	I
(	O
this	O
is	O
called	O
a	O

When	O
working	O
on	O
the	O
shoulder-in	B
,	O
it	O
is	O
highly	O
important	O
to	O
distinguish	O
between	O
a	O
horse	B
with	O
square	O
conformation	B
and	O
a	O
horse	B
with	O
rectangular	O
conformation	B
(	O
see	O
photos	O
)	O
.	O

The	O
square	O
horse	B
requires	O
more	O
lateral	B
bend	I
in	O
the	O
shoulder-in	B
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
execute	O
it	O
correctly	O
on	O
three	O
tracks	B
.	O

One	O
has	O
achieved	O
the	O
correct	O
amount	O
of	O
bend	B
when	O
the	O
horse	B
can	O
see	O
his	O
inside	B
hind	I
leg	I
with	O
his	O
inside	B
eye	I
.	O

In	O
this	O
ideal	O
case	O
,	O
the	O
horse	B
is	O
bent	B
like	O
a	O
banana	O
.	O

When	O
working	O
with	O
a	O
rectangular	O
horse	B
,	O
one	O
easily	O
ends	O
up	O
on	O
four	O
tracks	B
instead	O
of	O
three	O
if	O
one	O
allows	O
too	O
much	O
lateral	B
bend	I
.	O

The	O
rider	B
should	O
only	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
inner	O
half	O
of	O
the	O
horse	B
's	O
face	O
.	O

Generally	O
,	O
riders	B
do	O
better	O
with	O
rectangular	O
horses	B
because	O
we	O
tend	O
to	O
make	O
square	O
horses	B
too	O
short	O
in	O
their	O
necks	B
.	O

The	O
square	O
horse	B
's	O
body	O
is	O
already	O
so	O
compact	O
that	O
he	O
easily	O
gets	O
too	O
short	O
in	O
his	O
neck	B
when	O
sitting	B
more	O
on	O
his	O
haunches	B
,	O
such	O
as	O
when	O
riding	B
shoulder-in	B
.	O

When	O
and	O
How	O
to	O
Begin	O

In	O
dressage	B
tests	I
,	O
the	O
shoulder-in	B
is	O
introduced	O
at	O
Second	B
Level	I
.	O

When	O
schooling	B
,	O
I	O
recommend	O
using	O
it	O
also	O
at	O
First	B
Level	I
because	O
the	O
throughness	B
it	O
creates	O
in	O
the	O
horse	B
also	O
improves	O
his	O
straightness	B
.	O

Shoulder-in	B
improves	O
the	O
articulation	O
of	O
the	O
joints	B
in	O
the	O
haunches	B
,	O
improves	O
the	O
shoulder	B
freedom	I
and	O
makes	O
the	O
horse	B
more	O
supple	B
.	O

Furthermore	O
,	O
it	O
consolidates	O
a	O
horse	B
's	O
balance	B
,	O
and	O
he	O
becomes	O
more	O
obedient	B
.	O

Personally	O
,	O
I	O
teach	O
the	O
shoulder-in	B
to	O
very	O
young	O
horses	B
.	O

It	O
helps	O
them	O
develop	O
better	O
balance	B
earlier	O
on	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
are	O
better	O
gymnasticized	B
.	O

The	O
increased	O
sense	O
of	O
security	O
this	O
gives	O
them	O
also	O
makes	O
them	O
mentally	O
stronger	O
.	O

You	O
ca	O
n't	O
teach	O
an	O
old	O
dog	O
new	O
tricks	O
is	O
a	O
motto	O
I	O
like	O
to	O
apply	O
when	O
it	O
comes	O
to	O
essential	O
exercises	B
,	O
such	O
as	O
the	O
shoulder-in	B
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
recommend	O
that	O
an	O
inexperienced	O
rider	B
not	O
start	O
the	O
shoulder-in	B
before	O
the	O
horse	B
is	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
his	O
fourth	O
year	O
to	O
prevent	O
taking	O
away	O
too	O
much	O
rhythm	B
and	O
impulsion	B
from	O
the	O
horse	B
.	O

If	O
you	O
start	O
too	O
early	O
,	O
the	O
hindquarters	B
tend	O
to	O
be	O
left	O
out	O
behind	O
instead	O
of	O
stepping	B
more	O
under	O
.	O

A	O
shoulder-in	B
is	O
not	O
necessarily	O
a	O
correct	O
shoulder-in	B
.	O

It	O
all	O
depends	O
on	O
the	O
quality	O
of	O
the	O
execution	O

Voltes	B

These	O
small	O
circles	B
are	O
the	O
foundation	O
for	O
developing	O
the	O
shoulder-in	B
.	O

The	O
horse	B
must	O
have	O
learned	O
to	O
move	O
on	O
bent	B
lines	O
in	O
correct	O
lateral	B
bend	I
and	O
take	O
up	O
more	O
weight	O
with	O
his	O
inner	B
hind	I
leg	I
.	O

He	O
must	O
step	B
into	O
the	O
outside	B
rein	I
and	O
respond	O
to	O
half	B
halts	I
and	O
full	B
halts	I

The	O
rider	B
must	O
sit	O
in	O
balance	B
,	O
his	O
shoulders	B
parallel	O
to	O
the	O
horse	B
's	O
shoulders	B

If	O
all	O
of	O
this	O
is	O
in	O

one	O
can	O
begin	O
with	O
the	O
shoulder-fore	B

Shoulder-fore	B

I	O
start	O
by	O
setting	O
my	O
horse	B
up	O
for	O
a	O

through	I
the	I
diagonal	I
after	O
the	O
corner	B
of	O
the	O
short	B
side	I
of	O
the	O

However	O

instead	O
of	O
allowing	O
my	O
horse	B
to	O
actually	O
change	B
through	I
the	I
diagonal	I

I	O
continue	O
to	O
ride	B
down	O
the	O
long	B
side	I
with	O
this	O
same	O
amount	O
of	O
bend	B

This	O
way	O
I	O
achieve	O
a	O
shoulder-fore	B
,	O
a	O
preliminary	O
exercise	B
to	O
the	O
shoulder-in	B
.	O

The	O
goal	O
is	O
to	O
align	O
the	O
horse	B
's	O
legs	B
with	O
the	O
hind	B
legs	I
,	O
which	O
gives	O
the	O
horse	B
a	O
slight	O
flexion	B
and	O
bend	B

While	O
his	O

hind	I
leg	I
steps	B
between	O
his	O
front	B

must	O
remain	O
on	O
the	O

Because	O
the	O
horse	B

now	O
step	B
closer	O
together	O
,	O
this	O
preliminary	O

Shoulder-in	B

If	O
the	O

the	O

turns	O
into	O
a	O

It	O
's	O
crucial	O
that	O
the	O

then	O
his	O

To	O
really	O
live	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
horse	B
,	O
the	O
rider	B
must	O
mentally	O
divide	O
the	O
execution	O
of	O
the	O
shoulder-in	B
into	O
these	O
four	O
sections	O
.	O

Furthermore	O

being	O
two-legged	O

we	O
need	O

understand	O
the	O
situation	O
of	O
a	O
four-legged	O
creature	O

In	O
the	O
beginning	O

choose	O
a	O

tempo	B
that	O
gives	O
the	O
horse	B
the	O
chance	O
to	O
find	O
the	O
right	O

Once	O
the	O

not	O
impede	O
him	O

As	O
with	O
all	O
exercises	B

the	O

be	O
mentally	O

physically	O
at	O

three	O

of	O
the	O

In	O

the	O

The	O
horse	B
escapes	O
over	O

when	O
the	O

fails	O
to	O

For	O
the	O

This	O

the	O

multiplies	O

the	O

When	O

As	O
a	O

the	O

the	O

To	O
solve	O
the	O

the	O

begin	O

Furthermore	O

In	O
this	O

One	O

and	O
the	O
horses	B
often	O
also	O

in	O
their	O
necks	B

To	O
prevent	O
this	O
from	O
happening	O
,	O
the	O
rider	B
must	O
have	O
the	O
horse	B
set	O
up	O
correctly	O
in	O
preparation	O
for	O
the	O
shoulder-in	B

This	O
is	O
where	O
most	O
mistakes	O
occur	O

The	O
rider	B
will	O
again	O
have	O

in	O
the	O

At	O
the	O

time	O

the	O
shoulder-in	B
often	O
is	O
ridden	B
for	O
too	O
long	O
a	O
period	O
of	O
time	O

Quiet	O
horses	B
,	O
in	O
particular	O
,	O
will	O
quickly	O
lose	O
impulsion	B

The	O
rider	B
must	O
ride	B
short	O

only	O
and	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
end	O
the	O
exercise	B
at	O
the	O
best	O
moment	O

If	O
the	O
rider	B
exhausts	O
each	O
exercise	B
he	O

the	O
horse	B

If	O

exhaust	O
the	O
beautiful	O
exercises	B
too	O
often	O
,	O
we	O
destroy	O
them	O

Another	O
mistake	O
of	O
the	O
rider	B
is	O
that	O
he	O
demands	O
perfection	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
try	O

Instead	O
,	O
approach	O
an	O

perfection	O
in	O
the	O
second	O

third	O
attempt	O

First	O
,	O
the	O
horse	B

become	O

just	O

his	O

The	O
horse	B

rider	B

find	O

This	O
is	O
why	O
,	O
before	O
a	O

one	O

Tilting	O

recognize	O

If	O
the	O
ears	B

he	O
is	O
tilting	O

The	O
biggest	O
error	O
lies	O
in	O

If	O
the	O

the	O

To	O

this	O

A	O

so	O
when	O
he	O

his	O

the	O

through	O
his	O

that	O
rhythm	B

At	O

increase	O
the	O

most	O
