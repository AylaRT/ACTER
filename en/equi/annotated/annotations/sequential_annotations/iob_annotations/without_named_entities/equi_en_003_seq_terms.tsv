Classical	B

The	O
origins	O
of	O
classical	B
dressage	I
and	O
collection	B
lie	O
in	O
the	O
natural	O
ability	O
of	O
the	O
horse	B
and	O
its	O
movements	O
in	O
the	O
wild	O
.	O

In	O
fact	O
,	O
most	O
modern	O
definitions	O
of	O
dressage	B
state	O
that	O
the	O
goal	O
is	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
horse	B
perform	O
under	B
saddle	I
with	O
the	O
degree	O
of	O
athleticism	O
and	O
grace	O
that	O
it	O
naturally	O
shows	O
when	O

Horses	B
naturally	O
use	O
collection	B
when	O
playing	O
,	O
fighting	O
,	O
competing	O
and	O
courting	O
with	O
each	O
other	O
.	O

When	O
trying	O
to	O
impress	O
other	O
horses	B
,	O
they	O
make	O
themselves	O
look	O
bigger	O
,	O
just	O
as	O
other	O
animals	O
do	O
.	O

They	O
achieve	O
this	O
by	O
lifting	O
the	O
forehand	B
,	O
raising	O
the	O
neck	B
and	O
making	O
it	O
bigger	O
by	O
flexing	O
the	O
poll	B
,	O
while	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
transforming	O
their	O
gaits	B
to	O
emphasize	O
more	O
upwards	B
movement	I
.	O

When	O
fighting	O
,	O
the	O
horse	B
will	O
collect	B
because	O
in	O
collection	B
he	O
can	O
produce	O
lightning	O

spinning	O

striking	O
with	O
the	O

bucking	B
and	O
jumping	B

This	O
natural	O
ability	O
to	O
collect	B
is	O
visible	O
in	O
every	O
horse	B
of	O
any	O
breed	B
,	O
and	O
probably	O
inspired	O
early	O
trainers	B
to	O
reproduce	O

of	O
behavior	O

The	O

of	O

Classical	B

vs.	O

Modern	B

from	O

Unlike	O

competitive	B
dressage	I
does	O
not	O
require	O
the	O

which	O
most	O
horses	B
can	O
not	O
perform	O
well	O
even	O

In	O

However	O
,	O
there	O
has	O
been	O

that	O
is	O
in	O

Classical	B

criticize	O
such	O

on	O

grounds	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
biomechanically	O

are	O
painful	O
to	O

These	O

some	O
