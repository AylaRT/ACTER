Half-pass	B

The	O
half-pass	B
is	O
a	O
lateral	B
movement	I
seen	O
in	O
dressage	B
,	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
horse	B
moves	O
forward	B
and	O
sideways	B
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
.	O

Unlike	O
the	O
easier	O
leg-yield	B
,	O
the	O
horse	B
is	O
bent	B
in	O
the	O
direction	B
of	I
travel	I
,	O
slightly	O
around	O
the	O
rider	B
's	O
inside	B
leg	I
.	O

The	O
outside	B
hind	O
and	O
forelegs	B
should	O
cross	B
over	I
the	O
inside	B
legs	I
,	O
with	O
the	O
horse	B
's	O
body	O
parallel	O
to	O
the	O
arena	B
wall	B
and	O
his	O
forehand	B
leading	O
.	O

The	O
horse	B
should	O
remain	O
forward	B
,	O
balanced	B
,	O
and	O
bent	B
,	O
moving	O
with	O
cadence	B
.	O

The	O
inside	B

leg	I
remains	O
engaged	B
throughout	O
the	O
half-pass	B
,	O
and	O
the	O
horse	B
should	O
not	O
lose	O
its	O
rhythm	B

The	O
half-pass	B
is	O
a	O
variation	O
of	O
haunches-in	B
(	O
travers	B
)	O
,	O
executed	O
on	O
a	O
diagonal	B
line	I
instead	O
of	O
along	O
the	O
wall	B
.	O

At	O
higher	O
levels	O
it	O
is	O
used	O
to	O
perform	O
a	O
counter-change	B
of	I
hand	I
,	O
combining	O
more	O
than	O
two	O
half-passes	B
with	O
changes	O
of	O

in	O
a	O
zig-zag	O
pattern	O

The	O
Half-Pass	B
vs.	O
the	O
Leg-Yield	B

The	O
half-pass	B
requires	O
more	O
balance	B
,	O
engagement	B
,	O
and	O
collection	B
from	O
a	O
horse	B
than	O
the	O
leg-yield	B
.	O

This	O
is	O
because	O
the	O
horse	B
is	O
slightly	O
bent	B
in	O
the	O
direction	B
of	I
movement	I
in	O
the	O
half-pass	B
.	O

In	O
the	O
leg-yield	B
,	O
the	O
horse	B
is	O
fairly	O
straight	B
or	O
looking	O
slightly	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
direction	B
of	I
travel	I
.	O

The	O
Purpose	O
of	O
the	O
Half-Pass	B

The	O
half-pass	B
is	O
a	O
schooling	B
movement	B
that	O
requires	O
the	O
horse	B
to	O
engage	B
the	O
hindquarters	B
and	O
increase	O
its	O
impulsion	B
,	O
it	O
can	O
therefore	O
be	O
used	O
to	O
improve	O
both	O
collection	B
or	O
impulsion	B
.	O

The	O
half-pass	B
is	O
commonly	O
seen	O
in	O
dressage	B
tests	I
beginning	O

Performing	O
the	O

A	O
common	O
method	O
of	O
introducing	O
the	O
half-pass	B
:	O
riding	B
a	O
half	B
10-meter	I
circle	I
,	O
and	O
half-passing	B
from	O
the	O
centerline	B
back	O
to	O
the	O
rail	B

In	O
half-pass	B
the	O
horse	B
is	O
looking	O
into	O
the	O
direction	B
of	I
travel	I
,	O
bent	B
around	O
the	O
rider	B

The	O
half-pass	B
is	O
usually	O
taught	O
after	O
the	O

It	O
may	O

a	O
half-10-meter	B
circle	I
from	O
the	O

or	O
a	O
half-volte	B

The	O
circle	B
naturally	O
places	O
the	O
horse	B

body	O
in	O
the	O

and	O
helps	O
to	O
encourage	O
the	O

for	O
the	O
movement	B

The	O
outside	B
hind	I
leg	I
must	O
step	B
well	O

the	O
horse	B

A	O
rider	B
uses	O
an	O
