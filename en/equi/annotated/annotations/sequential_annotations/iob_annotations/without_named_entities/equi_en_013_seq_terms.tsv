to	O

When	O

Without	O
thoughtful	O

you	O
may	O
experience	O
some	O

problems	O

For	O
example	O
,	O
if	O
the	O
horse	B
is	O
n't	O
warmed	O
up	O
properly	O
,	O
then	O
the	O
work	O
can	O
be	O

for	O
him	O
or	O
cause	O

If	O
work	B

out	O

at	O
the	O

a	O

Ride	B
Structure	O
101	O

The	O
basic	O
structure	O
of	O
a	O
training	B
ride	B
for	O
every	O
horse	B
should	O
always	O
be	O
the	O
same	O
:	O
warm-up	B
,	O
work	B
sets	I
and	O
cool-down	B
.	O

There	O
is	O
much	O
room	O
for	O
variation	O
within	O
each	O
of	O
the	O
three	O
phases	O
for	O
each	O
individual	O
horse	B
.	O

The	O
amount	O
of	O
time	O
you	O
spend	O
in	O
each	O
phase	O
and	O
the	O
goal	O
of	O
each	O
phase	O
will	O
also	O
vary	O
from	O
day	O
to	O
day	O
.	O

Warm-Up	B

A	O
correct	O
warm-up	B
prepares	O
the	O
horse	B
's	O
joints	B
and	O
muscles	B
for	O
the	O
demands	O
of	O
the	O
work	B
sets	I
.	O

The	O
initial	O
10	O
minutes	O
of	O
a	O
ride	B
should	O
be	O
an	O
active	B
walk	B
on	O
long	B
reins	I
.	O

As	O
the	O
horse	B
walks	B
,	O
the	O
joint	B
fluid	O
circulates	O
and	O
lubricates	O
the	O
joints	B
.	O

Then	O
the	O
rider	B
should	O
establish	O
a	O
basic	O
connection	B
and	O
ride	B
five	O
to	O
10	O
minutes	O
of	O
working	B
trot	I
and	O
canter	B
on	O
20-meter	B
circles	I
,	O
straight	O
lines	O
,	O
bending	B
lines	O
and	O
changes	O
of	O
direction	O
.	O

This	O
pumps	O
oxygenated	O
blood	O
throughout	O
the	O
horse	B
's	O
muscles	B
so	O
that	O
the	O
muscle	B
fibers	O
become	O
warm	O
and	O
pliable	O
.	O

During	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
this	O
phase	O
,	O
the	O
horse	B
may	O
be	O
ready	O
for	O
more	O
suppling	B
work	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
leg	B
yields	I
and	O
15-meter	B
circles	I
.	O

By	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
warm-up	B
the	O
horse	B
should	O
be	O
confirmed	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
three	O
steps	O
of	O
the	O
Training	B
Scale—he	I
should	O
demonstrate	O
rhythmic	B
gaits	B
,	O
feel	O
supple	B
in	O
his	O
body	O
and	O
achieve	O
the	O
connection	B
required	O
for	O
the	O
work	O
ahead	O
.	O

Note	O
that	O
certain	O
types	O
of	O
horses	B
require	O
you	O
to	O
spend	O
more	O
time	O
in	O
the	O
warm-up	B
phase	O
.	O

For	O
example	O
,	O
horses	B
who	O
are	O
older	O
,	O
stiffer	O
or	O
have	O
had	O
time	O
off	O
take	O
longer	O
to	O
achieve	O
suppleness	B
.	O

Take	O
the	O
time	O
you	O
need	O
.	O

Especially	O
if	O
the	O
horse	B
is	O
coming	O
back	O
from	O
an	O
injury—patiently	O
warm	O
up	O
until	O
the	O
joints	B
,	O
ligaments	O
,	O
tendons	O
and	O
muscles	B
are	O
supple	B
.	O

Then	O
the	O
horse	B
has	O
the	O
optimal	O
chance	O
to	O
come	O
back	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
no	O
further	O
injury	O
.	O

The	O
warm-up	B
varies	O
from	O
horse	B
to	O
horse	B
.	O

Some	O
horses	B
loosen	O
up	O
better	O
in	O
the	O
canter	B
while	O
others	O
work	O
better	O
in	O
trot	B
early	O
on	O
.	O

Some	O
horses	B
may	O
need	O
more	O
bending	B
lines	O
to	O
control	O
the	O
tempo	B
while	O
others	O
need	O
more	O
straight	O
lines	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
engine	O
revving	O
.	O

Some	O
horses	B
may	O
take	O
up	O
to	O
30	O
minutes	O
to	O
feel	O
warmed	O
up	O
while	O
others	O
may	O
be	O
ready	O
to	O
work	O
after	O
15	O
minutes	O
.	O

Each	O
rider	B
needs	O
to	O
figure	O
out	O
the	O
best	O
warm-up	B
routine	O
for	O
her	O
individual	O
horse	B
,	O
but	O
the	O
result	O

Once	O
the	O

the	O

a	O
clear	O
plan	O
for	O
what	O
to	O

on	O
that	O

Build	O
your	O

in	O
a	O
systematic	O
way	O
to	O
set	O
the	O

up	O
for	O

I	O

the	O

For	O

if	O

such	O
as	O

The	O

you	O
enter	O
the	O

A	O
