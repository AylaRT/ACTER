The	O
ability	O
of	O
a	O
horse	B
to	O
perform	O
a	O
high-quality	O
piaffe	B
is	O
somewhat	O
innate	O
as	O
a	O
result	O
of	O
genetics	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
poor	O
training	B
can	O
easily	O
impair	O
the	O
horse	B
's	O
ability	O
to	O
piaffe	B
.	O

Good	O
training	B
is	O
absolutely	O
necessary	O
to	O
develop	O
every	O
horse	B
's	O
potential	O
to	O
piaffe	B
.	O

There	O
are	O
many	O
methods	O
of	O
teaching	O
piaffe	B

Most	O
horses	B
respond	O
best	O
to	O
a	O
combination	O
of	O
these	O
methods	O

It	O
's	O
best	O
to	O
introduce	O
piaffe	B
to	O
a	O
horse	B
fairly	O
early	O
in	O
his	O
training	B
.	O

But	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
common	O
mistake	O
to	O
show	B
piaffe	B
before	O
he	O
is	O
ready	O
,	O
causing	O
him	O
to	O
become	O
tense	O
when	O
asked	O
to	O
show	B
piaffe	B
in	O
a	O
test	B
.	O

Often	O
months	O
,	O
and	O
even	O
years	O
,	O
are	O
necessary	O
before	O
a	O
horse	B
clearly	O
understands	O
the	O
rider	B
's	O
aids	B
for	O
piaffe	B
or	O
becomes	O
strong	O
enough	O
physically	O
to	O
execute	O
piaffe	B
without	O
undue	O
stress	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
work	O
with	O
a	O
young	O
horse	B
,	O
I	O
first	O
need	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
decision	O
about	O

this	O
horse	B
will	O
be	O
asked	O
to	O
compete	O
at	O
the	O
Grand	B

level	O

If	O
the	O
answer	O
is	O
yes	O

I	O
know	O
that	O
I	O
must	O
plan	O

20	O

about	O
three	O
times	O

at	O

I	O
like	O
to	O
use	O
side	B

help	O
keep	O
his	O

I	O
begin	O
by	O
simply	O
asking	O
the	O
horse	B
to	O
walk	B
forward	B
a	O
few	O
steps	B
followed	O
by	O
a	O
halt	B

the	O

on	O

if	O
needed—to	O

I	O
give	O
the	O

an	O
easily	O

I	O
hold	O
the	O

It	O
is	O
important	O
to	O
stay	O
near	O
the	O

allowing	O

When	O
the	O

I	O
begin	O
to	O
ask	O
the	O

for	O
a	O

a	O

the	O

Then	O
I	O
praise	B
