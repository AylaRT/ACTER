Horses	B
need	O
plenty	O
of	O
free	B
walk	I
breaks	O
during	O
training	B
to	O
let	O
their	O
muscles	B
relax	B

Consistency	O
is	O
the	O
most	O
important	O
quality	O
in	O
the	O
training	B
so	O
the	O
standard	O
must	O
not	O
change	O
when	O
you	O
take	O
a	O
walk	B

If	O
the	O

the	O

your	O

feel	O

when	O

the	O

go	O
back	O

During	O
the	O
walk	B

ask	O
yourself	O

Is	O
my	O

If	O

when	O
you	O

your	O

The	O
rider	B
can	O
not	O
be	O
upset	O
with	O
the	O
horse	B
because	O
she	O
allowed	O
these	O

Besides	O
consistency	O
in	O
the	O
training	B
,	O
riding	B
a	O
good	O

walk	I
is	O
effective	O

Think	O
of	O
the	O

for	O
yourself	O
if	O
you	O

a	O

You	O

with	O
your	O

Riding	B
a	O

you	O
can	O

it	O
out	O

Riding	B
the	O
Walk	B

This	O
energetic	O

will	O
move	O
the	O

a	O
fair	O
amount	O

When	O
a	O
horse	B
marches	O

walk	I
with	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
energy	O
,	O
overtrack	B
and	O
stretch	B
,	O
he	O
must	O
use	O
his	O
back	B

a	O
lot	O
.	O

The	O
rider	B
must	O
follow	B
to	O
stay	O
with	O
that	O
movement	O
.	O

Moving	O
with	O
the	O
walk	B
means	O
your	O
whole	O
body	O
follows	B
the	O
movement	O
of	O
the	O
horse	B
's	O
whole	O
body	O

When	O
I	O
talk	O
specifically	O
about	O

I	O

to	O
the	O
rider	B
's	O
shoulders	B
,	O
elbows	B
,	O
forearms	B
and	O
hands	B

Most	O
people	O
are	O
aware	O
that	O
their	O
hips	B
must	O
move	O
with	O
the	O
horse	B
so	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
stiffen	O
and	O
therefore	O
tighten	O
the	O
horse	B
's	O
back	B
.	O

The	O
hips	B
must	O
follow	B
the	O
exact	O
movement	O
of	O
the	O
horse	B

The	O
leg	B
must	O
follow	B
the	O
horse	B
's	O
rib	B
cage	I
precisely	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
often	O
I	O
find	O
people	O
have	O
been	O
told	O
to	O
have	O
quiet	O
hands	B
,	O
and	O
they	O
think	O
that	O
means	O
having	O
hands	B
that	O
are	O
still	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
walk	B
,	O
especially	O
a	O
good	O
quality	O
walk	B
,	O
the	O
horse	B
must	O
oscillate	O
his	O
neck	B
forward	O
and	O
back	O
.	O

If	O
the	O
rider	B
does	O
n't	O
follow	B
this	O
oscillation	O
,	O
then	O
the	O
horse	B
will	O
not	O
feel	O
free	O
to	O
use	O
his	O
topline	B
.	O

Proper	O
following	B
in	O
the	O
walk	B
will	O
teach	O
the	O
horse	B
that	O
he	O
can	O
use	O
his	O
neck	B
and	O
increases	O
the	O
amount	O
he	O
uses	O
his	O
back	B

He	O
should	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
walk	B
through	O
his	O
whole	O

.	O

Conversely	O
,	O
a	O
rider	B
who	O
does	O
not	O
follow	B
with	O
the	O
walk	B
makes	O
the	O
horse	B
hold	O
his	O
head	B
and	O
neck	B
still	O
,	O
therefore	O
holding	O
and	O
tightening	O
his	O
back	B
,	O
making	O
the	O
walk	B
smaller	O
or	O
sometimes	O
even	O
compromising	O
the	O
four-beat	B
rhythm	B
of	O
the	O
walk	B

In	O
the	O
walk	B

the	O
rider	B
's	O

go	O

the	O

go	O
forward	O
and	O
down	O

only	O
as	O

as	O
the	O
horse	B
requires	O
to	O
maintain	O
a	O
steady	O

The	O

The	O

motion	O

I	O
always	O
urge	O

If	O

A	O
common	O

a	O

I	O
ask	O

the	O

For	O
example	O

a	O
horse	B
who	O
expects	O

will	O
be	O
very	O
sensitive	O
to	O
the	O
moment	O
when	O
the	O

give	O
a	O
half	B

One	O
of	O

a	O

a	O

This	O
transition	B
from	O

is	O
a	O
hard	O
one	O
for	O
many	O
horses—they	B
either	O
anticipate	O
an	O

transition	B
to	O
trot	B

get	O
tight	O

As	O
the	O

shortens	O
the	O

for	O

the	O
driving	B
leg	I

to	O
keep	O
the	O
energy	O

march	O
he	O

Then	O
the	O
core	B

the	O

engages	O

the	O

close	O
around	O

rebalance	B
the	O

or	O
shift	O
the	O

This	O
