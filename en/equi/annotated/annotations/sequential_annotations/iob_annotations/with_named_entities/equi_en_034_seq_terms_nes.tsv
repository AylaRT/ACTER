How	O
to	O
set	O
up	O
an	O
organized	O
,	O
effective	O
program	O
for	O
your	O
dressage	B
horse	I
.	O

For	O
centuries	O
,	O
the	O
gymnastic	B
training	B
system	O
of	O
dressage	B
has	O
proven	O
highly	O
effective	O
for	O
both	O
starting	O
young	O
horses	B
and	O
schooling	B
up	O
through	O
Grand	B
Prix	I
.	O

It	O
works	O
for	O
creatures	O
of	O
habit	O
,	O
like	O
the	O
horse	B
,	O
because	O
it	O
allows	O
them	O
to	O
know	O
what	O
is	O
expected	O
and	O
is	O
very	O
regimented	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
because	O
everything	O
you	O
begin	O
at	O
Training	B
Level	I
is	O
the	O
first	O
step	O
on	O
the	O
journey	O
to	O
upper-level	O
work	O
.	O

It	O
's	O
systematic	O
,	O
meaning	O
that	O
nothing	O
ever	O
really	O
changes—the	O
aids	B
are	O
always	O
the	O
same	O
through	O
each	O
level	O
of	O
training	B
.	O

For	O
example	O
,	O
the	O
aids	B
for	O
a	O
well-ridden	B
20-meter	B
circle	I
are	O
almost	O
the	O
same	O
as	O
the	O
aids	B
for	O
a	O
canter	B
pirouette	I
.	O

The	O
only	O
difference	O
is	O
that	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
higher	O
levels	O
,	O
the	O
horse	B
is	O
stronger	O
because	O
the	O
rider	B
has	O
incorporated	O
all	O
the	O
other	O
elements	O
of	O
the	O
training	B
scale—rhythm	I
,	O
suppleness	B
,	O
contact	B
,	O
impulsion	B
,	O
straightness	B
and	O
collection	B
.	O

Over	O
the	O
years	O
,	O
I	O
have	O
found	O
that	O
this	O
systematic	O
training	B
works	O
for	O
all	O
horses	B
,	O
regardless	O
of	O
their	O
breed	B
.	O

I	O
have	O
also	O
learned	O
the	O
importance	O
of	O
incorporating	O
certain	O
factors	O
into	O
my	O
dressage	B
training	I
and	O
I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
share	O

Recognizing	O
your	O

physical	O
and	O
mental	O
capabilities	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
important	O
part	O
of	O

training	B

For	O

you	O

a	O

ask	O
him	O
to	O
do	O
15	O

You	O
have	O
to	O
build	O
up	O
your	O
horse	B
's	O
mental	O
ability	O
and	O
physical	O
fitness	O
through	O
systematic	O
gymnastic	B
exercises	B

You	O
start	O
out	O
small	O
and	O
increase	O
as	O
his	O

strength	O
grow	O

Some	O
people	O
make	O
the	O

of	O
riding	B

young	O
or	O
green	O
horse	B
twice	O
a	O
week	O
to	O
go	O
easy	O
on	O
him	O

That	O
's	O
the	O
worst	O
way	O
to	O
approach	O
his	O
training	B
because	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
systematic	O

A	O
lot	O
of	O
time	O

energy	O
are	O
wasted	O
because	O
he	O
comes	O
out	O

does	O
n't	O
remember	O
much	O
from	O
the	O
last	O
time	O
he	O
was	O
ridden	B

The	O
better	O
plan	O
is	O
to	O
ride	B
for	O
20	O
minutes	O
six	O
days	O
a	O
week	O

That	O
consistency	O
will	O
build	O
his	O
physical	O

mental	O
fitness	O

Start	O
off	O
by	O
doing	O
basic	O
exercises	B
in	O

As	O
the	O

you	O

Your	O

You	O

your	O

and	O
you	O

a	O
better	O
rider	B

Consistent	O
work	O
makes	O

kinder	O
because	O

are	O
clearer	O
about	O
what	O

horses	B
are	O
fit	O

One	O
of	O
the	O
biggest	O
faults	O

that	O
people	O
do	O
n't	O
spend	O
enough	O
time	O
on	O
the	O
basics—rhythm	B
,	O
suppleness	B
and	O

But	O
getting	O
the	O
horse	B
loose	O
,	O
getting	O
the	O
contact	B
right	O
and	O
having	O
a	O
horse	B
that	O
wants	O
to	O
perform	O
for	O
you	O
is	O
difficult	O
and	O
more	O
important	O
to	O
achieve	O
.	O

You	O
just	O
have	O
to	O
sit	O
there	O
like	O
you	O
're	O
in	O
halt	B
and	O
let	O
the	O
horse	B
do	O
his	O
job	O
underneath	O
you	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
you	O
start	O
clamping	O

forcing	O

you	O
create	O
tension	O

which	O

A	O
systematic	O

approach	O

the	O
training	B

which	O

the	O
horse	B

rider	B
to	O
keep	O
a	O
positive	O
attitude	O

It	O
is	O
regimented	O

so	O
it	O
builds	O
up	O
confidence	O
in	O
both	O
horse	B

rider	B
because	O
they	O
know	O
what	O
is	O
expected	O

them	O

It	O
's	O
consistent	O

apply	O
and	O
build	O
on	O
the	O
aids	B
throughout	O
the	O
levels	O

And	O
it	O
makes	O

kinder	O
because	O
it	O
builds	O
on	O
the	O
physical	O
and	O
mental	O
fitness	O
of	O
your	O
horse	B
so	O
that	O
he	O
