When	O
you	O
are	O
teaching	O
your	O
horse	B
something	O
new	O
,	O
begin	O
on	O
his	O
good	O
side	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
positive	O
experience	O

.	O

When	O
you	O
are	O
teaching	O
piaffe	B
,	O
passage	B
and	O
pirouettes	B
it	O
is	O
best	O
to	O
do	O
everything	O
in	O
short	O
sets	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
better	O
to	O
do	O
many	O
short	O
spurts	O
than	O
a	O
few	O
over	O
an	O
extended	O
period	O
,	O
Charlotte	B
said	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
important	O
not	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
horse	B
muscle-sore	B
when	O
you	O
are	O
first	O
asking	O
for	O
more	O
collection	B
.	O

3	O
.	O

Think	O
about	O
riding	B
your	O
horse	B
up	O
and	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
you	O
.	O

Every	O
chance	O
you	O
get	O
,	O
put	O
your	O
hands	B
forward	O
so	O
you	O
can	O
meet	O
the	O
contact	B
out	O
further	O
.	O

Keep	O
thinking	O
about	O
the	O
frame	B
and	O
keeping	O
your	O
horse	B
growing	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
you	O
.	O

Both	O
horses	B
Charlotte	B
was	O
working	O
with	O
had	O
a	O
tendency	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
short	O
in	O
the	O
neck	B

As	O
you	O
transition	B
between	O
medium	B
,	O
working	B
and	O
collected	B
gaits	I
,	O
focus	O
on	O
riding	B
tactful	B
transitions	B
while	O
keeping	O
your	O
horse	B
's	O
neck	B
long	O
.	O

Again	O
she	O
was	O
referring	O
to	O
the	O
two	O
horses	B
who	O
had	O
a	O
tendency	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
short	O
in	O

5	O
.	O

If	O
you	O
struggle	O
to	O
maintain	O
power	O
in	O
the	O
trot	B
,	O
just	O
think	O
about	O
riding	B
medium	B
trot	I
without	O
actually	O
performing	O
medium	B
trot	I
.	O

Having	O
a	O
medium-trot	B
mentality	O
should	O
create	O
a	O
better	O
trot	B

To	O
ensure	O
correct	O
bend	B
in	O
the	O
haunches-in	B

imagine	O
wrapping	O
your	O
horse	B
's	O
body	O
around	O
your	O

As	O
you	O
prepare	O
to	O
ride	B
a	O
half	B
pass	I
,	O
make	O
sure	O
that	O
you	O
get	O
a	O
good	O
quality	O
shoulder-in	B
first	O
.	O

It	O
ensures	O
that	O
you	O
start	O
with	O
good	O
bend	B
and	O
an	O
uphill	B
balance	I
when	O
you	O
begin	O
the	O
half	B
pass	I
.	O

8	O
.	O

If	O
you	O
find	O
the	O
half	B
pass	I
challenging	O
,	O
try	O
this	O
exercise	B
:	O

Ride	B
shoulder-in	B
.	O

Ride	B
a	O
10-meter	B
circle	I
.	O

Return	O
to	O
shoulder-in	B
for	O
a	O
few	O
strides	B
.	O

Turn	O
the	O
shoulder-in	B
into	O
half	B
pass	I
.	O

This	O
exercise	B
is	O
effective	O
because	O
it	O
breaks	O
down	O
the	O
pieces	O
of	O
the	O
half	B
pass	I
(	O
shoulder-in	B
and	O
the	O
10-meter	B
circle	I
)	O
and	O
then	O
puts	O
them	O
back	O
together	O
in	O
a	O
logical	O
sequence	O
.	O

When	O
you	O
school	B
half	B
pass	I
,	O
do	O
n't	O
stay	O
in	O
the	O
movement	B
for	O
too	O
long	O
.	O

Go	O
back	O
to	O
shoulder-in	B
to	O
regain	O
the	O
bend	B
if	O
you	O
lose	O
it	O

Notice	O
that	O
the	O
concept	O
of	O
relaxation	B
has	O
two	O

that	O
the	O

physically	O

Your	O
horse	B

must	O
be	O
greater	O
than	O
your	O

exercises	B

10-meter	B
circles	I
to	O
naturally	O
encourage	O
collection	B

Leg	B

the	O

As	O
you	O
work	O

do	O
n't	O
forget	O
about	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O

the	O

something	O

Steffen	B
explained	O
that	O
Legolas	B

really	O
good	O
gaits	B
,	O
but	O
he	O
is	O
not	O
the	O
most	O
supple	B
horse	B

He	O
is	O
also	O
extremely	O
sensitive	O
,	O
which	O
can	O
be	O
both	O
an	O
advantage	O
and	O
a	O
disadvantage	O

To	O
get	O
the	O
most	O
out	O
of	O
him	O
,	O
Steffen	B
said	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
working	O
his	O
body	O
in	O
a	O
position	O
that	O
makes	O
him	O
feel	O
most	O
comfortable	O

For	O
every	O
horse	B

you	O
must	O
find	O
the	O
most	O
productive	O
frame	B
and	O
the	O
most	O
productive	O
tempo	B

he	O

For	O
Legolas	B
,	O
Steffen	B
finds	O
it	O
most	O

to	O
ride	B
in	O
a	O

To	O

suppleness	B
in	O
the	O

Steffen	B

a	O
go-to	O
exercise	B
:	O

Trot	B
down	O
the	O

side	I
in	O
counter	B

As	O
you	O

the	O

As	O
your	O

Do	O
not	O
be	O
afraid	O
to	O

hot	O
horses	B

It	O
's	O
tempting	O
to	O
ride	B
hot	O
horses	B
too	O
collected	B

he	O
said	O

Half	B
pass	I
is	O
a	O
good	O
movement	B
for	O
hot	O
horses	B
because	O
it	O
allows	O
you	O
to	O
actually	O
put	O
your	O
leg	B
on	O
while	O
the	O
horse	B
moves	O

Building	O

The	O
