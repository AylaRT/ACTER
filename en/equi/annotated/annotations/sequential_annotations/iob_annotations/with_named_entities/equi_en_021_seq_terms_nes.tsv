This	O
Olympian	O
shows	O
how	O
to	O
develop	O
your	O
horse	B
's	O
suppleness	B
,	O
collection	B
and	O
strength	O
with	O
haunches-in	B

Travers	B
is	O
a	O
fancy	O
name	O
for	O
a	O
very	O
down-to-earth	O
movement	B
,	O
haunches-in	B
,	O
which	O
is	O
just	O
that	O
:	O
As	O
the	O
horse	B
travels	O
in	O
a	O
straight	O
line	O
with	O
his	O
front	B
legs	I
,	O
he	O
bends	B
his	O
body	O
to	O
the	O
inside	B
,	O
bringing	O
his	O
haunches	B
in	O
off	O
the	O
track	B
.	O

Viewed	O
from	O
in	O
front	O
or	O
behind	O
,	O
he	O
travels	O
on	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
separate	O
tracks	B
,	O
with	O
his	O
hind	B
legs	I
moving	O
forward	B
and	O
sideways	B
in	O
a	O
crossover	B
fashion	O
.	O

The	O
outside	B
hind	I
leg	I
,	O
which	O
appears	O
to	O
cross	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
the	O
inside	B
hind	I
leg	I
,	O
provides	O
much	O
of	O
the	O
driving	B
power	I
for	O
the	O
movement	B
and	O
takes	O
on	O
more	O
of	O
the	O
horse	B
's	O
weight	O
by	O
stepping	B
increasingly	O
sideways	B
and	O
under	O
his	O
body	O
.	O

Introduced	O
at	O
Second	B
Level	I
,	O
the	O
travers	B
is	O
a	O
good	O
exercise	B
for	O
developing	O
suppleness	B
and	O
collection	B
,	O
for	O
correcting	O
straightness	B
problems	O
and	O
for	O
tuning	O
the	O
horse	B
to	O
the	O
rider	B
's	O
aids	B
.	O

Because	O
it	O
requires	O
the	O
horse	B
to	O
bend	B
in	O
his	O
body	O
and	O
work	O
much	O
harder	O
with	O
his	O
outside	B
hind	I
leg	I
,	O
this	O
exercise	B
will	O
strengthen	O
his	O
topline	B
,	O
back	B
and	O
hindquarters	B
and	O
encourage	O
him	O
to	O
shift	O
his	O
weight	O
backward	O
,	O
thus	O
achieving	O
more	O
collection	B
.	O

The	O
travers	B
also	O
teaches	O
the	O
horse	B
and	O
rider	B
two	O
new	O
concepts	O
that	O
will	O
be	O
invaluable	O
in	O
their	O
later	O
work	O
,	O
particularly	O
in	O
canter	B
pirouettes	I
and	O
the	O
half	B
pass	I
.	O

The	O
first	O
is	O
that	O
,	O
unlike	O
in	O
the	O
leg	B
yield	I
where	O
the	O
horse	B
is	O
bent	B
slightly	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
direction	O
he	O
's	O
traveling	O
,	O
in	O
haunches-in	B
,	O
he	O
bends	B
toward	O
the	O
direction	O
he	O
's	O
traveling	O
.	O

For	O
instance	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
's	O
doing	O
haunches-in	B
to	O
the	O
left	O
,	O
with	O
his	O
haunches	B
coming	O
off	O
the	O
track	B
to	O
the	O
left	O
,	O
his	O
body	O
bends	B
to	O
the	O
left	O
.	O

This	O
also	O
is	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
the	O
rider	B
uses	O
her	O
outside	B
leg	I
as	O
an	O
active	B
aid	I
.	O

Rather	O
than	O
supporting	O
the	O
bend	B
in	O
a	O
passive	O
way	O
,	O
the	O
outside	B
leg	I
initiates	O
the	O
haunches-in	B
movement	B
,	O
actively	B
cueing	O
the	O
horse	B
to	O
move	O
his	O
hindquarters	B
to	O
the	O
inside	B
.	O

Basic	O
Skills	O
Needed	O

Before	O
attempting	O
the	O
travers	B
,	O
you	O
and	O
your	O
horse	B
need	O
to	O
have	O
acquired	O
certain	O
basic	O
skills	O
.	O

He	O
needs	O
to	O
be	O
through	B
:	O
moving	O
forward	B
,	O
round	B
and	O
accepting	O
your	O
aids	B
.	O

He	O
must	O
be	O
competent	O
in	O
the	O
leg	B
yield	I
and	O
shoulder-in	B
and	O
demonstrate	O
some	O
respect	O
for	O
your	O
outside	B
aids	I
.	O

To	O
test	O
this	O
,	O
trot	B
a	O
circle	B
and	O
ask	O
him	O
to	O
leg	B
yield	I
toward	O
the	O
inside	B
of	O
the	O
circle	B
,	O
moving	O
off	O
your	O
outside	B
leg	I
and	O
hand	B
.	O

You	O
,	O
too	O
,	O
need	O
to	O
be	O
clear	O
on	O
the	O
concept	O
of	O
riding	B
forward	B
.	O

Impulsion	B
is	O
a	O
key	O
aspect	O
in	O
performing	O
a	O
good	O
travers	B
.	O

You	O
also	O
need	O
to	O
have	O
achieved	O
enough	O
independence	O
in	O
your	O
leg	B
,	O
seat	B
and	O
hands	B
that	O
you	O
can	O
use	O
each	O
aid	B
individually	O
.	O

In	O
other	O
words	O
,	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
want	O
to	O
accidentally	O
use	O
conflicting	O
aids	B
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
and	O
risk	O
confusing	O
your	O
horse	B
or	O
throwing	O
him	O
off	O
balance	B
.	O

Your	O
own	O
balance	B
in	O
the	O
saddle	B
is	O
extremely	O
important	O
in	O
travers	B
.	O

If	O
you	O
have	O
trouble	O
staying	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
it	O
's	O
easy	O
to	O
interfere	O
with	O
his	O
ability	O
to	O
perform	O
the	O
exercise	B
.	O

It	O
's	O
also	O
helpful	O
to	O
have	O
some	O
knowledge	O
and	O
feel	O
for	O
the	O
timing	O
of	O
the	O
horse	B
's	O
foot-falls	B
so	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
time	O
your	O
own	O
aids	B
more	O
effectively	O
.	O

Getting	O
Started	O

For	O
young	O
and	O
/	O
or	O
inexperienced	O
horses	B
,	O
travers	B
is	O
most	O
difficult	O
to	O
learn	O
at	O
the	O
walk	B
,	O
because	O
it	O
's	O
so	O
easy	O
to	O
lose	O
impulsion	B
.	O

I	O
prefer	O
to	O
teach	O
it	O
at	O
the	O
trot	B
or	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
's	O
sometimes	O
even	O
easier	O
for	O
horses	B
to	O
learn	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
canter	B
,	O
I	O
occasionally	O
start	O
with	O
that	O
.	O

Some	O
horses	B
,	O
particularly	O
tense	O
thoroughbred	B
types	O
,	O
figure	O
that	O
movement	B
out	O
faster	O
at	O
the	O
canter	B
.	O

Riders	B
also	O
often	O
find	O
timing	O
the	O
aids	B
easier	O
with	O
the	O
slower	O
canter	B
rhythm	I
.	O

The	O
simplest	O
way	O
to	O
teach	O
haunches-in	B
is	O
with	O
a	O
10	B
-	I
to	O
12-meter	B
circle	I
in	O
the	O
corner	B
of	O
the	O
arena	B
.	O

As	O
you	O
complete	O
the	O
circle	B
,	O
you	O
'll	O
maintain	O
the	O
forward	B
pace	O
.	O

As	O
your	O
horse	B
reaches	O
the	O
straightaway	B
,	O
you	O
'll	O
apply	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
outside	B
leg	I
to	O
prevent	O
his	O
haunches	B
from	O
reaching	O
the	O
track	B
and	O
continue	O
the	O
haunches-in	B
down	O
the	O
long	B
side	I
of	O
the	O
arena	B
.	O

On	O
the	O
circle	B
,	O
you	O
'll	O
establish	O
the	O
bend	B
of	O
your	O
horse	B
and	O
the	O
basic	O
position	O
of	O
your	O
body	O
that	O
you	O
'll	O
use	O
in	O
travers	B
.	O

When	O
you	O
leave	O
the	O
circle	B
to	O
begin	O
the	O
travers	B
down	O
the	O
long	B
side	I
,	O
you	O
'll	O
have	O
an	O
easier	O
time	O
holding	O
your	O
horse	B
's	O
hindquarters	B
to	O
the	O
inside	B
by	O
using	O
the	O
already	O
established	O
bend	B
from	O
the	O
circle	B
.	O

Be	O
sure	O
to	O
establish	O
a	O
good	O
bend	B
on	O
the	O
circle	B
,	O
using	O
your	O
inside	B
leg	I
at	B
the	I
girth	I
and	O
your	O
outside	B
leg	I
behind	B
the	I
girth	I
.	O

Then	O
increase	O
the	O
bend	B
slightly	O
by	O
bringing	O
your	O
horse	B
's	O
nose	B
to	O
the	O
inside	B
rein	I
until	O
you	O
can	O
see	O
his	O
nose	B
just	O
inside	B
his	O
shoulder	B
.	O

Prevent	O
his	O
outside	B
shoulder	I
from	O
falling	B
out	I
by	O
maintaining	O
a	O
steady	O
contact	B
with	O
your	O
outside	B
rein	I
and	O
keeping	O
your	O
inside	B
leg	I
active	B
.	O

Over	O
time	O
,	O
you	O
'll	O
want	O
your	O
connection	B
to	O
your	O
horse	B
to	O
shift	O
from	O
being	O
primarily	O
inside	B
rein	I
/	O
outside	B
leg	I
to	O
being	O
primarily	O
outside	B
rein	I
/	O
inside	B
leg	I
.	O

As	O
you	O
start	O
to	O
move	O
down	O
the	O
long	B
side	I
,	O
try	O
to	O
time	O
your	O
outside	B
leg	I
aid	I
so	O
that	O
you	O
squeeze	O
as	O
your	O
horse	B
's	O
outside	B
hind	I
leg	I
comes	O
off	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
thus	O
encouraging	O
it	O
to	O
cross	B
over	I
more	O
.	O

Otherwise	O
,	O
continue	O
using	O
the	O
same	O
bending	B
aids	I
(	O
supple	B
inside	B
rein	I
,	O
steady	O
outside	B
rein	I
and	O
active	B
inside	B
leg	I
)	O
you	O
had	O
on	O
the	O
circle	B
,	O
adding	O
a	O
little	O
extra	O
inside	B
leg	I
pressure	O
if	O
he	O
loses	O
impulsion	B
.	O

His	O
head	B
and	O
shoulders	B
will	O
remain	O
on	O
a	O
straight	O
line	O
on	O
the	O
track	B
.	O

Meanwhile	O
,	O
keep	O
your	O
head	B
and	O
upper	O
body	O
straight	O
and	O
facing	O
forward	O
,	O
focusing	O
your	O
eyes	B
down	O
the	O
length	O
of	O
the	O
straightaway	B
.	O

Allow	O
your	O
inside	B
hip	I
to	O
come	O
forward	O
slightly	O
to	O
match	O
the	O
forward	O
angle	O
of	O
your	O
horse	B
's	O
inside	B
hip	I
,	O
still	O
feeling	O
that	O
your	O
upper-body	O
weight	O
is	O
in	O
the	O
center	O
of	O
your	O
horse	B
.	O

Upper-level	O
riders	B
incorporate	O
a	O
small	O
weight	O
shift	O
to	O
the	O
inside	B
hip	I
in	O
their	O
cues	O
for	O
travers	B
,	O
however	O
,	O
this	O
easily	O
can	O
be	O
overdone	O
.	O

Less-experienced	O
riders	B
create	O
many	O
problems	O
by	O
focusing	O
too	O
much	O
on	O
this	O
weight	O
shift	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
early	O
stages	O
of	O
learning	O
,	O
you	O
need	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
sitting	B
squarely	O
in	O
the	O
saddle	B
,	O
without	O
leaning	O
or	O
trying	O
consciously	O
to	O
weight	O
one	O
hip	B
more	O
than	O
the	O
other	O
.	O

Concentrate	O
on	O
quietly	O
following	B
your	O
horse	B
's	O
motion	O
rather	O
than	O
pushing	O
it	O
with	O
your	O
seat	B
.	O

Although	O
your	O
horse	B
's	O
front	B
and	O
hind	B
legs	I
are	O
doing	O
two	O
different	O
things	O
,	O
you	O
must	O
ride	B
him	O
with	O
a	O
strong	O
feeling	O
of	O
connection	B
.	O

You	O
need	O
to	O
feel	O
a	O
symmetrical	O
bending	B
through	O
his	O
body	O
around	O
your	O
inside	B
leg	I
as	O
well	O
as	O
an	O
increase	O
in	O
power	O
generated	O
by	O
his	O
outside	B
hind	I
leg	I
.	O

This	O
power	O
must	O
translate	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
through	O
his	O
body	O
so	O
he	O
moves	O
in	O
one	O
smooth	O
,	O
coordinated	O
unit	O
.	O

To	O
create	O
this	O
feeling	O
,	O
you	O
need	O
to	O
coordinate	O
and	O
connect	O
your	O
own	O
aids	B
.	O

Rather	O
than	O
thinking	O
of	O
riding	B
his	O
front	B
end	I
and	O
hind	B
end	I
separately	O
,	O
think	O
of	O
using	O
your	O
legs	B
,	O
seat	B
and	O
hands	B
in	O
unison	O
to	O
ride	B
him	O
forward	B
into	B
the	I
contact	I

connecting	B
him	O
from	O
front	O
to	O
back	O
and	O
maintaining	O
the	O
bend	B
throughout	O
his	O
body	O
.	O

You	O
need	O
to	O
maintain	O
the	O
tempo	B
and	O
impulsion	B
of	O
the	O
trot	B
(	O
or	O
canter	B
)	O
throughout	O
the	O
movement	B
.	O

With	O
an	O
inexperienced	O
horse	B
,	O
you	O
may	O
have	O
to	O
slow	O
the	O
gait	B
down	O
slightly	O
to	O
allow	O
him	O
to	O
find	O
his	O
own	O
lateral	B
balance	I
initially	O
,	O
but	O
do	O
n't	O
slow	O
him	O
down	O
so	O
much	O
that	O
you	O
forfeit	O
the	O
quality	O
of	O
the	O
gait	B
.	O

At	O
first	O
,	O
only	O
expect	O
three	O
to	O
six	O
good	O
steps	B
of	O
haunches-in	B

As	O
he	O
starts	O
to	O
lose	O
the	O
bend	B
or	O
crossover	B
,	O
straighten	B
him	O
back	O
out	O
on	O
the	O

Try	O
the	O
exercise	B
again	O
with	O
another	O
circle	B
in	O
the	O
corner	B
at	O
the	O
other	O

of	O
the	O

Do	O
n't	O
overdo	O
it	O
,	O
though	O

Young	O
horses	B
learn	O
best	O
if	O
you	O
make	O
it	O
fun	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
're	O
not	O

if	O
you	O
keep	O

During	O
one	O

a	O
good	O

not	O
worrying	O
too	O
much	O
about	O
how	O

Then	O

do	O
the	O
opposite	O

on	O
the	O

not	O
worrying	O
quite	O
so	O
much	O
about	O
the	O
bend	B

As	O
he	O
grows	O
stronger	O
,	O
you	O
can	O
correct	O
a	O
haunches-in	B
that	O
's	O
not	O
quite	O
right	O
by	O
going	O
back	O
to	O
a	O
10-meter	B
circle	I
,	O
wherever	O
you	O
happen	O
to	O
be	O
on	O
the	O
long	B
side	I

reestablishing	O
the	O
bend	B
and	O
forward	B
rhythm	B

then	O
trying	O
the	O
haunches-in	B
again	O
as	O
you	O
come	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
circle	B

As	O
with	O
all	O
new	O
movements	B
,	O
it	O
's	O
best	O
to	O
ask	O
for	O
just	O
a	O
little	O
at	O
first	O

to	O
praise	B
you	O
horse	B
for	O
even	O
the	O

begins	O
to	O
understand	O
the	O
concept	O
and	O
grows	O
stronger	O
in	O
his	O
hind-end	B

you	O
gradually	O
can	O
ask	O
for	O
more	O
steps	B

more	O
bend	B

more	O
collection	B
