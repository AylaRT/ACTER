The	O

Ehrlich	B

sometimes	O
twice	O

first	O
just	O

The	O
early	O

consist	O
of	O

or	O
doing	O
a	O
little	O
at	O
a	O

then	O
OK	O

let	O

If	O
problems	O
arise	O
,	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
get	O
upset	O

We	O
just	O
decrease	O
the	O

go	O
back	O

For	O

two	O

were	O
involved	O
and	O
a	O
cotton	O

rope	I
was	O
used	O
.	O

A	O
chain	O
is	O
inappropriate	O
for	O
a	O
yearling	B
,	O
but	O
if	O
you	O
need	O
extra	O
reinforcements	O
,	O
you	O
can	O
place	O
Vetwrap	B
over	O
the	O
chain	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
less	O
severe	O
and	O
then	O
take	O
the	O
chain	O
over	O
the	O
nose	B
and	O
diagonally	O
across	O

under	O
the	O

if	O
a	O
youngster	O
refuses	O
to	O
go	O
forward	O

pulling	O
on	O
the	O

pressure	O
behind	O
the	O
poll	B

causing	O
panic	O

and	O
using	O
a	O

can	O

one	O

pushing	O
the	O

a	O

by	O
using	O
a	O

Take	O
a	O

all	O
her	O

Angel	B
needed	O
only	O
a	O

First	O
she	O

First	O
