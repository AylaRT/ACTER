This	O
picture	O
shows	O
Lone	B
Rytter	I
from	O
Denmark	B
riding	B
her	O
9-year-old	O
mare	B
,	O
who	O
has	O
limited	O
miles	O
under	B
saddle	I
.	O

Lone	B
herself	O
has	O
started	O
riding	B
again	O
after	O
a	O
15-year	O
break	O
.	O

Lone	B
reports	O
that	O
she	O
does	O
have	O
some	O
problems	O
with	O
her	O
shoulders	B
and	O
knows	O
that	O
she	O
tends	O
to	O
look	O
down	O
.	O

She	O
says	O
that	O
the	O
mare	B
can	O
get	O
a	O
bit	O
tense	O
going	O
to	O
shows	B
,	O
but	O
Lone	B
is	O
positive	O
that	O
this	O
will	O
get	O
better	O
with	O
some	O
more	O
experience	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
have	O
competed	O
together	O
only	O
four	O
times	O
.	O

At	O
first	O
glace	O
,	O
I	O
notice	O
that	O
this	O
horse	B
is	O
elegant	O
and	O
free-moving	O
and	O
she	O
sure	O
has	O
some	O
presence	O
and	O
beauty	O
within	O
her	O
movement	O
.	O

Good	O
activity	B
from	O
behind	O
and	O
a	O
nice	O
natural	O
uphill	B
movement	O
add	O
to	O
the	O
good	O
impression	O
.	O

Lone	B
's	O
seat	B
has	O
a	O
nice	O
correct	O
outline	O
.	O

I	O
like	O
her	O
long	O
leg	B
position	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
hard	O
to	O
judge	O
from	O
this	O
angle	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
do	O
get	O
the	O
impression	O
that	O
she	O
is	O
sitting	O
carefully	O
and	O
appears	O
to	O
be	O
hovering	O
a	O
bit	O
above	O
the	O
horse	B
.	O

I	O
would	O
like	O
her	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
deep	O
and	O
connected	B
through	O
her	O
seat	B
.	O

This	O
could	O
be	O
the	O
reason	O
why	O
her	O
heel	B
is	O
slightly	O
up	O
even	O
though	O
her	O
leg	B
appears	O
long	O
.	O

Or	O
maybe	O
this	O
picture	O
was	O
taken	O
when	O
Lone	B
was	O
in	O
rising	B
trot	I
in	O
the	O
moment	O
just	O
before	O
she	O
sat	O
down	O
again	O
.	O

From	O
my	O
teaching	O
experience	O
,	O
I	O
do	O
know	O
that	O
riders	B
who	O
restart	O
riding	B
after	O
a	O
long	O
break	O
have	O
not	O
forgotten	O
how	O
to	O
ride	B
(	O
it	O
's	O
like	O
riding	B
a	O
bicycle	O
)	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
they	O
do	O
have	O
more	O
difficulty	O
in	O
finding	O
a	O
deep	O
and	O
connected	B
seat	B
and	O
they	O
ride	B
somewhat	O
mechanically	O
until	O
their	O
body	O
regains	O
core	B
stability	O
and	O
elasticity	O
.	O

Lone	B
comments	O
on	O
her	O
shoulder	B
problems	O
,	O
which	O
are	O
most	O
likely	O
connected	O
to	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
she	O
needs	O
to	O
create	O
more	O
positive	O
tension	O
within	O
her	O
upper	O
body	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
picture	O
,	O
her	O
shoulders	B
are	O
very	O
slightly	O
rounded	O
and	O
her	O
challenge	O
will	O
be	O
to	O
correct	O
her	O
shoulder	B
position	O
without	O
stiffening	O
up	O
and	O
losing	O
the	O
forward	B
elasticity	O
in	O
her	O
hands	B
.	O

During	O
her	O
warm-up	B
,	O
she	O
should	O
try	O
this	O
:	O
Deliberately	O
move	O
different	O
parts	O
of	O
your	O
body	O
because	O
playing	O
between	O
areas	O
of	O
stability	O
and	O
areas	O
of	O
mobility	O
trains	O
body	O
awareness	O
and	O
coordination	O
.	O

You	O
can	O
turn	O
your	O
head	B
rhythmically	O
in	O
rising	B
trot	I
,	O
looking	O
to	O
the	O
inside	B
,	O
straight	O
ahead	O
and	O
to	O
the	O
outside	B
.	O

While	O
turning	O
your	O
head	B
,	O
you	O
should	O
make	O
sure	O
that	O
your	O
hands	B
stay	O
parallel	O
and	O
forward	O
,	O
rather	O
than	O
follow	O
toward	O
the	O
side	O
you	O
turn	O
.	O

Next	O
,	O
keep	O
your	O
head	B
quiet	O
and	O
move	O
your	O
shoulders	B
,	O
alternating	O
up	O
and	O
down	O
,	O
circling	O
forward	O
and	O
backward	O
like	O
rowing	O
or	O
swimming	O
.	O

Again	O
,	O
your	O
hands	B
should	O
stay	O
as	O
quiet	O
as	O
possible	O
when	O
you	O
move	O
your	O
shoulder	B
blades	I
.	O

These	O
exercises	B
help	O
release	O
tension	O
in	O
the	O
body	O
and	O
give	O
you	O
a	O
feel	O
for	O
controlling	O
your	O
arm	B
movement	O
from	O
your	O
core	B
.	O

With	O
better	O
mobility	O
in	O
her	O
shoulders	B
,	O
Lone	B
can	O
start	O
building	O
up	O
more	O
stability	O
,	O
too	O
.	O

To	O
combine	O
core	B
stability	O
with	O
correct	O
breathing	O
while	O
gaining	O
a	O
better	O
shoulder	B
position	O
,	O
Lone	B
can	O
try	O
the	O
following	O
exercise	B
:	O
Sit	O
on	O
your	O
horse	B
at	O
the	O
walk	B
.	O

As	O
you	O
breathe	O
in	O
,	O
allow	O
your	O
shoulders	B
to	O
rise	O
slightly	O
up	O
toward	O
your	O
ears	B
.	O

As	O
you	O
breathe	O
out	O
,	O
slowly	O
push	O
your	O
shoulders	B
down	O
but	O
stretch	B
your	O
spine	B
up	O
longer	O
.	O

This	O
lengthening	O
of	O
your	O
spine	B
while	O
breathing	O
out	O
slowly	O
builds	O
up	O
positive	O
tension	O
along	O
your	O
back	B
.	O

It	O
is	O
important	O
that	O
you	O
keep	O
reaching	O
down	O
with	O
your	O
seat	B
bones	I
,	O
deepening	O
your	O
seat	B
to	O
avoid	O
tension	O
in	O
your	O
buttocks	B
.	O

To	O
help	O
riders	B
feel	O
better	O
stability	O
around	O
their	O
shoulder	B
girdle	O
,	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
helpful	O
to	O
imagine	O
that	O
the	O
rein	B
does	O
not	O
just	O
run	O
from	O
the	O
horse	B
's	O
mouth	B
to	O
the	O
rider	B
's	O
hand	B
,	O
but	O
that	O
the	O
arm	B
is	O
actually	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
rein	B
,	O
and	O
forms	O
a	O
circle	O
that	O
starts	O
from	O
the	O
bit	B
and	O
runs	O
up	O
the	O
reins	B
and	O
rider	B
's	O
arms	B
and	O
connects	O
between	O
the	O
shoulder	B
blades	I
.	O

Imagining	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
copy	O
of	O
the	O
bit	B
hanging	O
between	O
your	O
shoulder	B
blades	I
on	O
your	O
back	B
can	O
give	O
you	O
a	O
better	O
feel	O
for	O
this	O
connection	B
.	O

Another	O
picture	O
I	O
think	O
is	O
helpful	O
:	O
Instead	O
of	O
taking	O
your	O
shoulders	B
back	O
,	O
which	O
often	O
creates	O
tension	O
,	O
imagine	O
moving	O
your	O
shoulder	B
blades	I
in	O
the	O
shape	O
of	O
a	O
big	O
heart	O
on	O
your	O
back	B
.	O

Move	O
your	O
shoulder	B
blades	I
slightly	O
up	O
,	O
widen	O
them	O
and	O
then	O
bring	O
them	O
down	O
and	O
more	O
together	O
.	O

And	O
as	O
you	O
connect	O
your	O
shoulders	B
,	O
your	O
hands	B
should	O
push	O
forward	O
in	O
contrast	O
.	O

This	O
will	O
help	O
Lone	B
be	O
able	O
to	O
give	O
her	O
hand	B
a	O
better	O
forward	B
tendency	I
while	O
staying	O
more	O
connected	O
with	O
her	O
body	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
.	O

I	O
hope	O
that	O
these	O
tips	O
and	O
images	O
can	O
be	O
helpful	O
for	O
her	O
so	O
that	O
she	O
and	O
her	O
beautiful	O
mare	B
can	O
enjoy	O
performing	O
together	O
in	O
the	O
