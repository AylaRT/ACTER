A	O
:	O
This	O
is	O
a	O
wonderful	O
question	O
for	O
me	O
as	O
I	O
use	O
the	O
turn	B
on	I
the	I
forehand	I
a	O
lot	O
.	O

I	O
think	O
what	O
you	O
are	O
observing	O
are	O
variations	O
of	O
the	O
exercise	B
more	O
than	O
different	O
versions	O
.	O

Turns	B
on	I
the	I
forehand	I
are	O
basically	O
lateral	B
movements	I
.	O

We	O
teach	O
them	O
because	O
they	O
promote	O
suppleness	B
and	O
obedience	B
.	O

A	O
certain	O
degree	O
of	O
obedience	B
and	O
submission	B
is	O
necessary	O
to	O
perform	O
this	O
exercise	B
.	O

A	O
larger	O
circle	O
of	O
the	O
front	B
feet	I
and	O
more	O
bend	B
throughout	O
the	O
body	O
are	O
easier	O
than	O
a	O
smaller	O
circle	O
and	O
less	O
bend	B
throughout	O
the	O
body	O
with	O
the	O
front	B
feet	I
staying	O
more	O
on	O
the	O
spot	O
.	O

The	O
smaller	O
diameter	O
of	O
the	O
forehand	B
turn	I
with	O
less	O
bend	B
requires	O
that	O
the	O
horse	B
has	O
learned	O
how	O
to	O
stay	O
in	O
a	O
frame	B
and	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
is	O
reliably	O
obedient	B
to	O
the	O
driving	B
aids	I
and	O
submissive	O
to	O
the	O
rein	B
aids	I

He	O
has	O

to	O
respond	O
to	O
a	O

combination	O
of	O
aids	B

He	O

We	O
are	O
talking	O
about	O
collection	B
here	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
offer	O
that	O
the	O
smaller	O
turn	B
on	I
the	I
forehand	I
is	O
being	O
done	O
by	O
a	O
horse	B
who	O
is	O
more	O
advanced	O
in	O
his	O
training	B
.	O

Since	O
progress	O
can	O
be	O
measured	O
by	O
the	O
degree	O
of	O
collection	B
a	O
horse	B
is	O
capable	O
of	O
,	O
the	O
turn	B
on	I
the	I
forehand	I
is	O
a	O
good	O
indicator	O
of	O
where	O
the	O
horse	B
is	O
in	O
his	O
education	O
.	O

Training	B
the	O
turn	B
on	I
the	I
forehand	I
helps	O
horses	B
understand	O
the	O
bending	B
and	O
the	O
straightening	B
aids	I
.	O

I	O
find	O
it	O
the	O
crucible	O
of	O
their	O
dressage	B
education	O
.	O

A	O
more	O
advanced	O
horse	B
will	O
exemplify	O
the	O
concepts	O
of	O
the	O
training	B
scale	I
:	O
a	O
clear	O
walk	B
rhythm	B
,	O
relaxation	B
,	O
a	O
supple	B
connection	B
to	O
the	O
outside	B
rein	I
and	O
a	O
willingness	O
to	O
be	O
straightened	B
.	O

Referring	O
to	O
the	O
easier	O
variation	O
of	O
the	O
turn	B
on	I
the	I
forehand	I
,	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
front	B
legs	I
describe	O
a	O
larger	O
circle	O
and	O
the	O
horse	B
is	O
allowed	O
some	O
bend	B
to	O
the	O
inside	B
,	O
that	O
horse	B
could	O
be	O
at	O
an	O
earlier	O
stage	O
of	O
his	O
education	O
.	O

Very	O
soon	O
in	O
his	O
career	O
,	O
a	O
dressage	B
horse	I
will	O
have	O
to	O
perform	O
movements	B
on	O
two	O
tracks	B
,	O
or	O
lateral	B
movements	I
.	O

Crossing	O
the	O
front	O
and	O
back	B
legs	I
can	O
be	O
confusing	O
to	O
the	O
horse	B
.	O

I	O
teach	O
lateral	B
exercises	I
in	O
the	O
walk	B
so	O
the	O
horse	B
learns	O
the	O
response	O
to	O
the	O
aids	B
without	O
losing	O
his	O
balance	B
.	O

All	O
trainers	B
have	O
a	O
system	O
they	O
have	O
developed	O
that	O
asks	O
the	O
horse	B
to	O
obey	O
simple	O
aids	B
:	O
the	O
leg	B
aids	I
,	O
which	O
mean	O
go	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
rein	B
aids	I
,	O
which	O
mean	O
stop	O
or	O
turn	O
.	O

Eventually	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
necessary	O
to	O
combine	O
these	O
aids	B
in	O
a	O
way	O
that	O
produces	O
a	O
more	O
complex	O
crossing	O
of	O
the	O
legs	B
and	O
bending	B
of	O
the	O
body	O
.	O

Once	O
the	O
horse	B
is	O
comfortable	O
with	O
the	O
driving	B
and	O
turning	B
aids	I
in	O
trot	B
and	O
canter	B
,	O
I	O
start	O
asking	O
for	O
the	O
turn	B
on	I
the	I
forehand	I
in	O
the	O
walk	B
.	O

I	O
ride	B
a	O
10-meter	B
circle	I
and	O
ask	O
the	O
hind	B
legs	I
to	O
cross	O
to	O
the	O
outside	B
.	O

In	O
the	O
beginning	O
,	O
I	O
hold	O
the	O
horse	B
's	O
head	B
to	O
the	O
inside	B
with	O
the	O
inside	B
rein	I
.	O

I	O
use	O
the	O
whip	B
gently	O
on	O
the	O
flank	B
to	O
get	O
the	O
hindquarters	B
to	O
move	O
away	O
from	O
pressure	O
.	O

I	O
combine	O
that	O
with	O
a	O
cluck	B
of	O
my	O
tongue	B
,	O
and	O
soon	O
the	O
horse	B
will	O
move	O
away	O
from	O
a	O
very	O
light	O
pressure	O
on	O
his	O
side	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
early	O
stages	O
,	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
care	O
how	O
much	O
the	O
horse	B
bends	B
his	O
neck	B
because	O
I	O
want	O
him	O
to	O
concentrate	O
on	O
obedience	B
to	O
the	O
leg	B
aid	I
.	O

Once	O
he	O
obeys	O
the	O
leg	B
aid	I
consistently	O
,	O
I	O
start	O
to	O
add	O
the	O
outside	B
rein	I
to	O
limit	O
the	O
degree	O
of	O
bend	B
throughout	O
the	O
whole	O
length	O
of	O
the	O
body	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
horse	B
can	O
comfortably	O
move	O
around	O
my	O
inside	B
leg	I
,	O
I	O
start	O
to	O
ask	O
for	O
even	O
more	O
straightness	B
laterally	O
.	O

That	O
creates	O
more	O
crossing	O
of	O
the	O
hind	B
legs	I
and	O
therefore	O
has	O
a	O
greater	O
suppling	B
effect	O
on	O
the	O
loin	B
muscles	B
.	O

When	O
the	O
straightness	B
becomes	O
too	O
difficult	O
,	O
I	O
relax	O
the	O
outside	B
rein	I
a	O
bit	O
.	O

When	O
teaching	O
the	O
turn	B
on	I
the	I
forehand	I
,	O
I	O
do	O
it	O
continually	O
until	O
the	O
horse	B
finds	O
his	O
balance	B
and	O
is	O
confident	O
in	O
the	O
exercise	B
.	O

Gradually	O
,	O
I	O
reduce	O
the	O
diameter	O
of	O
the	O
circle	B
so	O
that	O
the	O
front	B
legs	I
stay	O
more	O
on	O
the	O
spot	O
and	O
I	O
limit	O
the	O
degree	O
of	O
bend	B
.	O

When	O
the	O
horse	B
accepts	O
making	O
the	O
circle	B
smaller	O
,	O
he	O
has	O
started	O
to	O
understand	O
a	O
lot	O
more	O
about	O
accepting	O
the	O
aids	B
,	O
which	O
will	O
produce	O
collection	B
.	O

As	O
with	O
everything	O
new	O
,	O
patient	O
repetition	O
is	O
the	O
key	O
.	O

Of	O
course	O
,	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
do	O
the	O
exercise	B
on	O
both	O
sides	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
side	O
will	O
always	O
be	O
better	O
than	O
the	O
other	O
.	O

When	O
a	O
horse	B
can	O
be	O
adjusted	O
from	O
a	O
big	O
circle	B
to	O
a	O
smaller	O
one	O
,	O
I	O
feel	O
an	O
important	O
plateau	O
has	O
been	O
reached	O

The	O
horse	B
and	O
I	O
have	O
reached	O
a	O
higher	O
level	O
of	O
cooperation	O
and	O
