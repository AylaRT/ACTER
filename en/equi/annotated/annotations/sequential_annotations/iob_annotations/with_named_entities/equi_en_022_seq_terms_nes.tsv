This	O
is	O
an	O
elegant	O
pair	O
.	O

Horse	B
and	O
rider	B
are	O
well	O
turned	O
out	O
.	O

Although	O
glove	B
color	O
is	O
not	O
specified	O
by	O
the	O
AHSA	B
,	O
I	O
wish	O
the	O
rider	B
would	O
not	O
show	O
in	O
black	O
gloves	B
.	O

White	O
gloves	B
are	O
more	O
traditionally	O
correct	O
and	O
would	O
enhance	O
this	O
picture	O
.	O

The	O
rider	B
has	O
a	O
lovely	O
position	O
and	O
should	O
be	O
proud	O
of	O
her	O
correct	O
rein	B
position	O
.	O

The	O
horse	B
is	O
calm	O
,	O
round	B
and	O
balanced	B
in	O
the	O
canter	B
and	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
paying	O
excellent	O
attention	O
to	O
his	O
rider	B
,	O
who	O
also	O
is	O
paying	O
excellent	O
attention	O
to	O
her	O
horse	B
.	O

However	O
,	O
there	O
are	O
things	O
that	O
could	O
make	O
this	O
picture	O
even	O
better	O
.	O

There	O
is	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
much	O
of	O
a	O
moment	B
of	I
suspension	I
in	O
this	O
canter	B
.	O

It	O
needs	O
more	O
jump	B
.	O

The	O
horse	B
is	O
not	O
jumping	B
enough	O
to	O
lift	O
himself	O
off	O
the	O
ground	O
after	O
the	O
landing	O
of	O
the	O
right	O
fore	O
.	O

I	O
can	O
see	O
this	O
because	O
the	O
right	O
hind	O
has	O
not	O
landed	O
far	O
enough	O
under	O
the	O
horse	B
's	O
body	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
left	B
hind	I
toe	I
is	O
still	O
in	O
the	O
sand	O
.	O

If	O
he	O
were	O
jumping	B
better	O
,	O
the	O
right	O
hind	O
would	O
have	O
landed	O
closer	O
to	O
the	O
line	O
drawn	O
through	O
the	O
rider	B
's	O
body	O
:	O
ear	B

hip	B

heel	B
,	O
instead	O
of	O
12	O
to	O
14	O
inches	O
behind	O
her	O
heel	B
.	O

In	O
the	O
very	O
moment	O
pictured	O
here	O
,	O
the	O
rider	B
should	O
try	O
to	O
activate	B
the	O
hind	B
quarters	I
of	O
her	O
horse	B
,	O
inspiring	O
him	O
to	O
jump	B
more	O
under	O
himself	O
in	O
the	O
next	O
stride	B
,	O
and	O
then	O
the	O
next	O
,	O
until	O
he	O
understands	O
that	O
she	O
wants	O
him	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
active	B
behind	O
.	O

He	O
is	O
trying	O
to	O
please	O
her	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
obvious	O
from	O
his	O
willing	O
,	O
attentive	O
expression	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
probably	O
assumes	O
that	O
this	O
flat	O
canter	B
is	O
what	O
she	O
wants	O
.	O

Although	O
she	O
should	O
not	O
get	O
angry	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
she	O
should	O
make	O
it	O
clear	O
that	O
she	O
wants	O
more	O
jump	B
in	O
the	O
canter	B
she	O
should	O
explain	O
this	O
through	O
seat	B
and	O
lower	B
leg	I
pressure	O
,	O
reinforced	O
with	O
a	O
light	O
touch	O
of	O
the	O
whip	B
behind	O
her	O
leg	B

The	O
canter	B
pictured	O
,	O
although	O
harmonious	O
and	O
smooth	O
looking	O
,	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
sufficient	O
impulsion	B
and	O
engagement	B
to	O
do	O
upper-level	O
movements	B
such	O
as	O
half	B
pass	I
or	O
pirouettes	B
in	O
the	O
collected	B
canter	I
.	O

Lower-level	O
training	B
should	O
prepare	O
the	O
horse	B
for	O
upper-level	O
collection	B
.	O

This	O
means	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
lower	O
levels	O
,	O
the	O
rider	B
should	O
develop	O
the	O
gaits	B
to	O
produce	O
the	O
engagement	B
and	O
strength	O
the	O
horse	B
will	O
need	O
to	O
perform	O
the	O
upper-level	O
work	O
.	O

This	O
rider	B
's	O
excellent	O
seat	B
will	O
provide	O
her	O
with	O
the	O
ability	O
to	O
get	O
more	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
basics	O
with	O
her	O
horse	B
